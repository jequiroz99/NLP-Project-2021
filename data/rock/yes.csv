the gates of delirium,"Stand and fight, we do consider. Reminded of an inner pact between us, that's seen as we go. And ride there, in motion. To fields in depth of honour, defending. Stand the marchers soaring talons. Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom, fighting we know. Destroy oppression, the point to reaction. As leaders look to you, attacking. Choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor. Kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow. Casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force. To alter via the war that's seen, as friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem. Wars that shout in screams of anguish. Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver, surely we know. In glory we rise to offer. Create our freedom, a word we utter. A word. Words cause our banner, victorious our day. Will silence be promised as violence displays. The curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day. Our gods awake in thunderous roars and guide the Leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause. Listen, should we fight forever. Knowing as we do know, fear destroys. Listen, should we leave our children. Listen, our lives stare in silence. Help us now. Listen, your friends have been broken. They tell us of your poison, now we know. Kill them, give them as they give us. Slay them, burn their children's laughter. On to hell. The fist will run, grasp metal to gun. The spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum. Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn. The pen won't stay the demon's wings. The hour approaches, pounding out the Devil's sermon. . Soon, oh soon the light. Pass within and soothe this endless night. And wait here for you. Our reason to be here. Soon, oh soon the time. All we move to gain will reach and calm. Our heart is open. Our reason to be here. Long ago, set into rhyme. Soon, oh soon the light. Ours to shape for all time, ours the right. The sun will lead us.

the revealing science of god (dance of the dawn),"Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources. Chased amid fusions of wonder. In moments hardly seen forgotten. Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge. Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole. Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days undersearching earth. Revealing corridors of time provoking memories. Disjointed but with purpose. Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp and tender love. As we took to the air a picture of distance. Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused expression. As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing late into corners. And we danced from the ocean. Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many wont to follow. Only tunes of a different age. As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting. Talk to the sunlight caller. Soft summer mover distance mine. Called out a tune but I never saw the face. Heard but not replaced. I ventured to talk but I never lost my place. Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day. Lost in lights array. I ventured to see as the sound began to play. What happened to this song we once knew so well. Signed promise for moments caught within the spell. I must have waited all my life for this. Moment moment. The future poised with the splendour just begun. The light we were as one. And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun. And for a moment when our world had filled the skies. Magic turned our eyes. To feast on the treasure set for our strange device. What happened to wonders we once knew so well. Did we forget what happened, surely we can tell. We must have waited all our lives for this. Moment moment moment. Starlight movement. Reasons. Release forward. Tallest rainbow. Sun shower seasons. Life flower reasons. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe that I can feel it. There's someone to tell you. Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you. Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest. Thoughts would send our fusion clearly to be home. Getting over wars we do not mean, or so it seems so clearly. Sheltered with our passion clearly to be home. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe they really mean to. There's someone to tell you. And I just can't believe our song will leave you. Skyline teacher. Warland seeker. Send out poison. Cast iron leader. And through the rhythm of moving slowly. Sent through the rhythm work out the story. Move over glory to sons of old fighters past. Young Christians see it from the beginning. Old people feel it, that's what they're saying. Move over glory to sons of old fighters past. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe they really mean to. There's someone to tell you. A course towards a universal season. Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest. They might stand and leave them clearly to be home. Getting over wars they do not mean, we charm the movement suffers. Call out all our memories clearly to be home. We've moved fast, we need love. A part we offer is our only freedom. What happened to this song we once knew so well. Signed promise for moments caught within the spell. We must have waited all our lives for this. Moment moment. Past present movers moments we'll process the future,. But only through Him we know. Send flowered rainbows. A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs.

america,"Paul Simon. (Full version on Yesterdays, The New Age of Atlantic, or KTA). (Edited single version is available on the Yesyears album). Let us be lovers. We'll marry our fortunes together. I've got some real estate here in my bag. So we bought a pack of cigarettes. And Mrs. Wagner's Pies. And walked on, walked on, walked on. To look for America. 'Kathy,' I said as we boarded a Greyhound to Pittsburg,. 'Michigan seems like a dream to me now'. It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw. All gone to look for America. All gone to look for America. Laughing on the bus. Playing games with the faces. She said the man in the Gabardine suit was a spy. I said, 'Be carefull his bow tie is really a camera.'. Kathy I'm lost I said. Although I knew she was sleeping. I'm empty and I'm aching. And I don't know why. Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike. They've all come to look for America. All come to look for America. All come to look for America."
and you and i,"I Cord of Life. A man conceived a moment's answer to the dream. Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes. As a foundation left to create the spiral aim. A movement regained and regarded both the same. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed. Between the picture of time behind the face of need. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. Emotions revealed as the ocean maid. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Coins and crosses. (Turn round tailor, assauting). Never know their fruitless worth. (all the mornings of the interest shown,. presenting one another to the cord). Cords are broken. (All left dying, rediscovered. Of the door that turned round). Locked inside the mother Earth. (To close the cover, all the. interest shown). They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you. (To turn one another, to the. sign at the time float your climb). Watching the world, watching all of the world. Watching us go by. And you and I climb over the sea to the valley. And you and I reached out for reasons to call. II Eclipse. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. Emotions revealed as the ocean maid. As a movement regained and regarded both the same. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. III The preacher, the teacher. Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time. Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme. There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify. Political ends as sad remains will die. Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you. Oooh, ooh. I listened hard but could not see. Life tempo change out and inside me. The preacher trained in all to lose his name. The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same. In the end we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize. That the truth of man maturing in his eyes. All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid. As a moment regained and regarded both the same. Emotion revealed as the ocean maid. A clearer future, mornig, evening, nights with you. IV Apocalypse. And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning. And you and I reach over the sun for the river. And you and I climb, clearer towards the movement. And you and I called over valleys of endless seas."
angkor wat,"Out of the brightest tree the moon became the morning sun,. And there again reflected on the dreams of everyone.. Out of the starlight night the telling of all our lives,. And racing faster than the Northwestern World.. Starpoint to signal our endlessness. Starpoint to signal this evermore. Starpoint to compass: We look to the North. To return to the centre: Angkor Wat.. (Cambodian Poetry)."
arriving ufo,"(Jon Anderson/Steve Howe/Rick Wakeman). I could not take it oh so seriously really. When you called and said you'd seen a UFO. But then it dawned on me the message in writing. Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before. I looked out, in the night. Strange and startling. Was this voice of time just saying. There's got to be a linking of everyone. Got to be a centre. It all comes flooding back. Arriving thru eons of times immortal power of the future to behold. Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have. known. So look out, in the night. Once they arrive. On that perennial light. Impress a bolder empire of energy. In the ships we see. The coming of outer space. You say there's no reason to conjure. With the force as it has been known to be see. You say I'm a fool, a believer. Put your feet on the earth it is green. But look out, in the night. Wait for they arrive. To start such sciences anew. Here it is the coming of outer space. Such a pure delight. The coming of outer space."

be the one,"The One. Never underestimate the loving. How we intertwine our very soul. How we fill each other's spaces. to lose control. When you're talking, be the children. Who stand on solid ground. Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around. I'll be there, to bring you this love in the morning. I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night. I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing. Never underestimate a giver. The gift of love will surely be. When you're asking for the secrets to set you free. When you're talking to the friendship. That love of higher self. This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts. Be the one, giving in to love. Never let the good in life desert you. Be the one, giving in to love. Never let the fools destroy your dreams. Be the one, giving in to love. I can dream myself every minute. So how did we become, masters of limitation?. I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there. To make it right for you. Giving in, giving in to love. It's the balance of this everyday feeling. Giving in, giving in to love. Without love our dreams become illusion. Giving in, giving in to love. I can hear you singing every minute. So you can sing the song, and see the truth. Humankind. So we worked all around amidst the glory of life. Any fire of the flame would be made. Should the famine of change to diguise everyone. Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made. But all because we're changing now. As the prophets of doom speak their mind. It's a long, long way from where the system began. It's a long, long way humankind. So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat. All our efforts as one sent today. Taking back instead of giving. taking back more or less. Taking back a sense of being afraid. So all this necessary changes now. as the will to help all man. And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead. But all this senseless killing. and all these chains and lies. I want to know right now, I want to know right now. I want to know where we come from. For it's a long, long way. from where the system began. It's a long, long way humankind. it's a long, long way from where the system began. it's a long, long way humankind, yeah. Giving in, giving in to love. I can see and feel the truth every minute. Giving in, giving in to love. Be the one to rescue you, rescue you. Giving in, giving in to the right love. There's no way that you can live without it. So we can become masters of our invention. Skates. (Instrumental). Don't stand still. Repeat chorus. Never underestimate the power. Never underestimate the power"
beyond and before,"(Squire/Bailey). Sparkling trees of silver foam cast shadows in winter home,. Swaying branches breaking sound, lonely forest trembling ground.. Masquerading leaves of blue run circles round the morning dew,. Patterns understood by you, reaching out beyond and before.. Time, like gold dust, brings mind down to hidden levels underground,. Say a few words to the wind, that's all that's left of winter's friend.. Reaching the snow in the days of the cold, casting a spell out of ice.. Now that you're gone,. The summer's too long and it seems like the end of my life. Beyond and before.. Time, like gold dust, brings mind down.."

birthright,"(Anderson / Howe / Wakeman / Bruford / Bacon). In 1954 the British Government, in order to maintain the balance. of power between East and West, exploded their first atom bomb at. Woomera. They failed to contact all of the Aborigine peoples at. the time. The Aborigines still call this 'the day of the cloud.'. A new born land. Dreaming by the sky. The scent of colours. In the flowers. Believe it's small. In many ways. It holds the key. That divides the super powers. This road is never lonely. To ENGLAND they are tied. They were blasted by the Silver Cloud. There were blasted to the wall alive. This place, this place ain't big enough for stars and stripes. Counting out the statesmen. Bungling one by one. Spelling out this segregation. So the catchword be. Looking after number one. They release the fear inside. Are human after all. So begins our dream time. They hunted like the dinosaur. We the pure. They the savage innocent. How we crush our existence after all. Come on. For without them. We are lonely. This England we are blind. Like all the Empires crumble. Will surely change the tide. This place ain't big enough for red and white. This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes. This place - This place. This place is theirs, by their birthright. This place. The sun gives better reasons. United we are blind. To deliver our existence. Keep it up. Keep it up. This human tide, give it some. We can break the ties. Of recent changes. Know the ones who. Hold the key. Singing out the congregation. We are them and they are we. This place ain't big enough for red and white. This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes. This place. This place. This place is theirs by their birthright."

can you imagine,"Anderson/Howe/Squire/White. September 11, 2001. Can you imagine what itâ€™s like seeing life. From the other side. Do you imagine darkened light, starless night?. You might need a guide. And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts. And alter your mind. Or become a delusion, include you. Change your existence. For another kind.

changes,I'm moving through some changes. I'll never be the same. Something you did touched me. There's no one else to blame. The love we had has fallen. The love we used to share. We've given up pretending. As if you didn't care. Change changing places. Root yourself to the ground. Capitalize on this good fortune. One word can bring you round. Changes. I look into the mirror. I see no happiness. All the warmth I gave you. Has turned to emptiness. The love we had has fallen. The love we used to share. You've left me here believing. In love that wasn't there. Change changing places. Root yourself to the ground. Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming. One word can bring you round. Changes. When I look into your eyes and try to find out how. There's no way to save it now. And everything I feel. Changes. Keep looking for. Changes. Changes. For some reason you're questioning why. I always believe it gets better. One difference between you and I. Your heart is inside your head. One word from you. One word from me. A clear design on your liberty. Who could believe when love has gone. How we move on like everyone. Only such fools. Only such jealous hearts. Only through love changes come. Change changing places. Root yourself to the ground. Capitalize on this good fortune. One word can bring you round. Changes. One road to loneliness. It's always the same. One road to happiness. It's calling your name. Change changing places - Changes. Root yourself to the ground. Capitalize on this good fortune. One word can bring you round. Changes. Change changing places. Changes. Root yourself to the ground. Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming. One word - One word can bring you round. Changes

circus of heaven,"(Jon Anderson). The day the Circus of Heaven came to town. Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town. Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around. On the very last day. A unicorn headed the mystical way. Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play. Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colours of jade. On the very final day. For what seemed only just a moment in time. Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by. Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold. The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time. There then arose where nothing really stood there before. A giant tent rising one thousand feet high frofrom the floor. Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed. To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age. A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound. Bringing out the strangest visions in perfect harmony round. Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen. From historical or mythical scenes. Then there above their heads just as vivid as life. Each vision transported multitudes inventing light. Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon. A play of millions roared along. The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great. Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate. All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way. The day the circus came to town. Outside great animals as tame as the trees. Angels high in starlight dancing streets. Turning their colours with indigo and gold. Dropping violet, red and emerald snow. As the circus finally changed its invisible course. A new world to be found. On the dreamy ground we walked upon. I turned to my son and said. ""Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary. beautiful?"". ""Oh! It was OK!! But there were no clowns, no lions, no tigers, no bears, cand-floss, toffee apples, no clowns."""
city of love,City of love City of love City of love. Once bitten twice shy. No - No regrets at all. Justice - Body smooth take over. Good girls they work the city. Good guys they spike you hard. How they jive ad jingle. When you're in their backyard. Street corner wonder lust. Beckoning the good guy. Take this get that. Have a good time. He young and tactile. He ready for anything that is. How they jive and jingle. They've read the book that gives. We'll be waiting for the night. We'll be waiting for the night to come. We'll be waiting for the night. We'll be waiting for the night to come. Supervise this good treatment. Alternative line by line. So the street guys so observant. Take him for a ride. Have a good time.

We'll be waiting for the night. We'll be waiting for the night to come. Solo. Good timing has its good price. One trick and you're stuck with the dice. How they jive and jingle. When you're their sacrifice. Fast as lightning. Go - Go get high - He's looking good. Once bitten twice shy. No woman no cry. No woman don't cry. We'll be waiting for the night. We'll be waiting for the night to come. (repeat three times).
clear days,"(Anderson). I once knew a sweet young girl;. Her body was her world of love,. Her laughter was as happiness is.. Of all the times I treasure this.. And on a day we will remember,. On a clear day we will love forever.. I once knew a sweet young dream,. That if life itself were all we had. And who are we to ask for more;. Let's not decide, let's be sure.. And on a day we will remember,. On a clear day we'll all be together,. Together.."
close to the edge,"I The Solid Time Of Change. A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace. And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace. And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar. Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour. And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one. A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun. And take away the plain in which we move. And choose the course you're running. Down at the edge, round by the corner. Not right away, not right away. Close to the edge, down by a river. Not right away, not right away. Crossed the line around the changes of the summer. Reaching out to call the color of the sky. Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see. Getting over all the time I had to worry. Leaving all the changes far from far behind. We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name. Down at the end, round by the corner. Close to the edge, just by a river. Seasons will pass you by. I get up, I get down. Now that it's all over and done. Now that you find, now that you're whole. Ii Total Mass Retain. My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love. It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above. I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand. There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand. Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see. As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea. There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be. Down at the edge, close by a river. Close to the edge, round by the corner. Close to the end, down by the corner. Down at the edge, round by the river. Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory. All in all, the journey takes you all the way. As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known. Guessing problems only to deceive the mention. Passing paths that climb halfway into the void. As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain. Down at the edge, round by the corner. Close to the end, down by a river. Seasons will pass you by. I get up, I get down. Iii I Get Up, I Get Down. In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking. Saying that she'd take the blame. For the crucifixion of her own domain. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. Two million people barely satisfy. Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late. The eyes of honesty can achieve. How many millions do we deceive each day?. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. In charge of who is there in charge of me. Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?. The truth is written all along the page. How old will I be before I come of age for you?. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. Iv Seasons Of Man. The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes. A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems. And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love. As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above. Ah, ah. Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space. He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race. I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place. On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley. Called to witness cycles only of the past. And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark. Close to the edge, down by the river. Down at the end, round by the corner. Seasons will pass you by. Now that it's all over and done. Called to the seed, right to the sun. Now that you find, now that you're whole. Seasons will pass you by. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. I get up, I get down. I get up"

Cars screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven,. guns are loaded,. locked in vengeance. Who shoots the child?. Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life. Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life. Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,. Feed us in the raw, fear is all we fear about. Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up.

So dangerous - This fear of love. So dangerous - Can you handle it?. So dangerous - To love. So dangerous - Everyone else can do it. Walking the street, you're breaking your love.. Lose your heart, all in a mess.. In the middle of the night, looking for a little. Hands to the sun; don't show your body.. Death defying - Hurt by love. Passing through shadows - Don't lose your body. So dangerous - This fear of love. So dangerous - Can you handle it?. So dangerous - To keep this fear of love. So dangerous - To let it go. I don't imagine, I don't imagine as it is;. Don't get confused.. In the light, through the night.... Look in the light, through the night. Look in the light of what you're searching for.. Hide from your heart here in the arms of wanting.. Hide from the dark here in the arms of love.. Run from the fear inside the darkest reaches.. Look to yourself; you'll see the path is clear. So dangerous - This fear of love. So dangerous - Can you handle it?. So dangerous - To love. So dangerous - Everyone else can do it. Take what you have into the arms of wanting (to the arms of love)....."

If time will allow. We will judge all who came. In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail. Don't kill the whale. CETACEI....."

endless dream,"(Trevor Rabin/Jon Anderson). Hold your head up high you know you've. Come a long way, a long way. Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say. Temptation may come hope your vision doesn't stray. In the name of God you may be forced away. Moving forward to the only place you know. Side tracked by some indiscretion. Changing as you go. Temptation may come hope your. Conscience doesn't hide. The longest trip you'll take is inside. It's the last time telling myself everything. Call me over then bring me back again. It's the last chance telling myself. That I believe. Your forever is mine and all I need. Now life tell me now in your arms. All I really need is you by my side. I sing this to you all the world and all it is. I bring this to you this gift of love. And the world turns and the world turns. Time tells all we know we look to it. Jesus on the radio. Pledge me what you got I'll give you. Eternal resting spot. How intense I pray depends on how much you pay. It's the last time getting it this life. First calling in a silent spring. It's the first time getting it this life. First calling in a silent spring. Fear strikes deeper than visionary. Screams and tears never justify this love. Talk talk listening. Like the first words ever to reach out. Talk talk. Like the first sounds in a silent spring. Talk talk listening. Like the first words ever to reach out to you. Talk talk. Like the first sound you start to sing. So take your time. Look round and see. The most in time is where you're meant to be. For they talk too loud. And take the hope and peace from your heart. We call this surrender. Slowly towards the north. And this endless dream giving ourselves everything. We're deserving we're gonna bring it back again. It's the last time telling myself everything. It's the last time bring me back bring me back again. When the world brings you down. You can search you inside. For the love you will find (bring me back home). When the world brings you down. You can search you inside. When the world brings you down. I've waited so long. When the world brings you down. You gotta play this living game. When the world brings you down. So take your time. Look round and see. The most in time is where you're meant to be. For you are light. Inside your dreams. For you will find that it's soomething. That touches me."

friend of a friend,"You found folks treat you right. As long as you let them know. You've been ready to defend their right. Through doors that they oppose. But if it chokes you let it go. If it doesn't sound true to you. It's no business of yours. You can count friends on your fingers. Count 'em on your toes. If you leave you are a friend of all. Those friendships heaven knows. But there comes a time when your testimony. Will crumble like a rose. Let's have no pretense. It's over. Friendships can never be forgotten. It's all there. True friends will never question you. You. And it's all there. In the stories. We're about to read of a long time ago. And it's really always been there. To let you know. There are times way back in history. Where valor overcame. The almighty tyrants of the past. Forgotten all but name. As the sons of righteous leaders. Bent on crushing nations. Thus believe the sprirt just. And it's all there. Frienships can never be forgotten. In the end years. You've got to hold on to what you've got. What you've got. And it's all there. In the stories. We're about to read of a long time ago. In the modern day around. You let it show. You can see love deep in children's eyes. Feel 'em in the wind. You can reach the blessings of the. Innocence on which we meet. You can guide love in the atomosphere. Arising from the source. You know the citizen of chance is. Another citizen of choice. If you're mortal, be detroyed. Then immortal be the course"

He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,. Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,. Doubted that he would, doubted..

What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of ones so dear,. Instead of ones so dear, so dear.. Going home, He's going home to the land he loved so well.. Going home, He fought for two years, never fell.. Going home, He's going home,. Going home. He's going home.. Harold Land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage,. Clutching red ribbons from a badge, but he didn't look his age.. Only two years had passed between his leaving home and back;. He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack, leading the attack.. In conversation it could be said,. Well after war your heart is dead.. Well it's not hard to understand,. There is no heart in Harold Land.."

in the presence of,"Anderson/Howe/Squire/White. September 11, 2001. Deeper than every ocean. Deeper than every river. Thatâ€™s what your presence brings to me. Revealing the words I listen. Seeing you in my silence. Learning Iâ€™m with you constantly. As I was before. If we were flowers. We would worship the sun. So why not now?. This high is shining brightly. Brighter than before. As the door was open wide. There inside was a diamond chair. Where I sat when I was young. I wrote down the words. Only when the young at heart. Can enter the real world. This chance Iâ€™ve waited for. For you to see. If I had chances I would spend them with you. To hold you close and let your love surround me. Deeper than before. (Deeper than every ocean). And I know this love is real. (Deeper than every river). Realize this is meant to be. Thatâ€™s what your eyes they say to me. You are listening to how I feel. So expectedly. (Brighter than every morning). From the ocean to the sky. (Beautiful as the sunset). Every river to the sea. Nature surrounds me constantly. We can hear love constantly. This is for you and me. Turn around and come deeper now. So what happens when I touch you there. You feel the words roll over you. Thinking of the better scenes. The memories. As everybody else just. Hasnâ€™t got the time. To help you anymore. â€™Cause if the reason for. The things that pleasure us. To please ourselves. Not pressure us. To give our ego. Some pleasure time. Can you imagine. Any reason. To know youâ€™re only fooling yourself. And then youâ€™ll understand why. Youâ€™ll understand why. So if we choose to realize. All existence is a dream. This perfect resume to you. From me. Just had a tough time with magic. The death of ego. The moon. It was just coming through. Send me such a good time. In a letter form, tell me. The pleasure, no pressure. Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream. I get amazed like a true beginner. I get amazed like a true believer. I get amazed when I see you there. And I come alive. I believe Iâ€™m a true beginner. I believe Iâ€™m a true beginner. In your arms I can see it all. I can see it all. If we were flowers. We would worship the sun. So why not now?. This light is burning brightly. This light is burning brightly. Brighter than before. Brighter than before. Brighter than before. Brighter than before. Turn around and remember that. When it gets so low. As you finally hit the ground. Turn around and remember that. Now Iâ€™m standing tall. Standing on my sacred ground. Turn around and remember that. When it gets so low. As you finally hit the ground. Turn around and remember that. Now youâ€™re standing tall. Standing on sacred ground. Standing on sacred ground. Standing on sacred ground."
in the tower,"Like a stair reach up. As moonlight, as of fire. In the middle of desire. By the master light that sees us in the wind. We carry on, on and on. Like coldness in the wind. That would change life's true desire. Seeing winter, summer, autumn, spring again. In the quiet of morning mist. I dream of you. In the tallest tower I think I always will. Tall death that haunted me so. Can't find no well design. Can't help it on your own. Surley time will come. When the talents of a lifetime spent with you. Surely makes the best of chance. Like the wind can tell us. For what is true is life. Days gone by. Days gone by. Days gone by. We meet by the tower of true love. We sit beside us in the rain. Smiling with the raindrops clear. Like the sun can tell us. For what is true is life. For what is true is life. For what is true is life"

life on a film set,All the poems of my neighbors. That drift across the sand. Are just the tindrels of a vast. But gentle plant which they command. The headdress of a goddess. You wore the night we came. Is only one small symptom. And really not to blame. You're riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Heaven send immortals. Waged upon the wall. And light wires all the missiles. Shot to make them fall. Everlasting movie. Picture into frame. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. All of the beaches. Into the sky. Into the bleach of sunglass goodbye. Key grip was crying. This boy was made. Here in the shelter. Whole want afraid. We were there. Follow the road that leads to the sun. Who formed our leader he is the one. Who will offer the silence. You must beware. Using the page that no one can share. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Out of the morning. Into the day. Onto the evening. Nowhere to stay. We were always together. Always the same. Into the future. Noone to blame. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger. Riding a tiger

madrigal,"(Jon Anderson/Rick Wakeman). I will be there said my friend of a distant life. Covered in greens of a golden age, set in stone. Follow me, ""he sounded of dreams supreme"" follow me. Drifting within the glow and the after-glow of the eve. And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame. Sacred ships do sail the seventh age. Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love. Most of all play with the game of the age. Highest of places remain all as one with you. Giving us light and the freedom of the day. And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame. Sacred ships do sail the seventh age. And have always been here. Celestial travellers have always been here with us. Set in the homes of the universe we have yet to go. Countless expansions will arrive and flow inside of us. My friend, he of fantasy, dancing with the spirit of the age."

I'm clinging to the edge of every world. Spinning in creation. So afraid to let my feelings really show. Teach me to teach me. How the keys unlock the door. As we open it we surrender, holding hands with many more. There's a feeling that's coming. There's a feeling so real. To justify, to magnify, to realize that everything is love. Now, after all the love you have. You can always get it back. Knowing how you really see. Knowing it will come to you. Knowing that it can really be. Magnificate, magnification.

Without the thread between together. This would be the golden thread of trust. Speak to me, teach me. Magnify the truth you are. Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star. A symbol is planted. On the brow of every child. To justify, to magnify. To realize that everything is love. Now giving all the love you have. You will always get it back. Giving all the love you have. You can always get it back. Giving all the love you have. Giving all the love. Magnificate, magnification. Magnificate, magnification. First you're smaller being alive.

new language,"Anderson/Squire/Howe/White/Sherwood/Khoroshev. I speak from some sort of protection of learning. Even tho' I make it up as I go on. A special trait is that I've tried. To reach all feelings. So I speak a new language of love. Some say that it is written in the circle. Others that it is written in the sun. But I protect myself by seeing this experience. As a metaphor for moving on. Sometimes I check myself. To start to believe in. The horoscopes you read everyday. They're telling me somethings. I really ought to know. But then again I like to. Then again I learn to. Then again I'm running away. Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself. Vision forgets who is real. On the city streets, people get lost. Just waiting for history.

Is there something that I'm supposed to teach. (Speak to me). Is there something that I'm supposed to find. As I reach to the healing in each spoken word. For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute. I'm chasing every second before I let go. Yesterday my history. Dreams are still a mystery. This living is a gift I should know. Lay it down and let me live the new language. Let me learn at every twist every turn. Lay it down and let me love the further future. Let me know I'm running. Let me know I'm learning. Let me know I'm moving on. Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself. Chasing the reason. For all kinds of wondering. People embracing these feelings of limbo. Just waiting for some kind of truth. Taking a chance as it comes only once. Only strength can do justice. With words of new languages. Translate creation. To bring you salvation. Your voice is the perfect key. (Talk to me). Is there something that. I'm supposed to see. (Speak to me). Is there something that I'm. Supposed to feel. I'm with you. And I can't help but want to know. (New languages). (Talk to me).

How you help me. With your eyesight. Only when we touched. Did it all come true. How you understand my life. How you helped me with your light."
real love,"(Trevor Rabin/Chris Squire/Jon Anderson). Get the fire as the flame it burns. Get the wind as it slowly turns. Get the earth as it circles by. Get the sky sea creation fly. This point of living. This point of giving. This chance of living has got to be known. Get the fire as the flame it burns. Get the wind as it slowly turns. Get the earth.... Get the sky.... Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind. To the animal, primalistic grind. You bring me reason, a simple fact of life (Bring me reason...). You don't say you're sorry.... Call this real love. Activates this mission to be. On the same timeline. Call this free love. Get a ticket on the master plan. On the freedom climb. Get the fire as the flame it burns. Get the wind as it slowly turns. Get the earth.... Get the sky.... The point of living. The point of living. This chance of living. Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind. To the animal, the primalistic grind. You bring me reason, a simple fact of life. You don't say you're sorry. Call this free love. Activate the mission tobe on. The same timeline. Call this free love. Get a ticket on the master plan. On the freedom climb. Call this free love. You can activate this message. On the concourse of your fine mind. Call this real love. Get off those chains, get off those chains. Get off those changes coming to you."
rejoice,"(Jon Anderson). Rejoice forward out this feeling. Ten true summers long. We go round and round and round and round. Until we pick it up again. Time flies, on and on it goes. Thru the setting sun. Carry round and round and round and round. Until it comes to carry you home. Rejoice forward out this feeling. The white eagle soars. He goes round and round and round. Until the early winds of change. Dawn's new light conquering timeless ease. Spread the harvest breeze. Let our hour of passion. Gently hold our heads on high with you. Gently hold our heads on high."
"release, release","(Jon Anderson/Alan White/Chris Squire). Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back. Rock is the medium of our generation. Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout. For the right of all of creation. We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move. The pressure's on is there lack of concentration. Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now. Show us how amid the rack of confusion. Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan. Set it out for all to understand it. We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move. The pressure's on is there lack of concentraion. Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is. Seems to me, it's as simple as this. No matter, where you go, you're going to find. You won't see me in front, but you can't leave me behind. Power at first to the needs of each others' days. Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways. All unaccounted for in the craziness of power. In the craziness. Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother. Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister. Release, release, enough controllers. Show some signs of appreciated loyalties. Release, release, enough controllers. Show some signs of appreciated loyalties. Straight jacket, freedom's march, is it all, far beyond. Our reason of understanding. Campaign everything, anti-right, anti-left. Anticipate the love of creation. Stand for every right. Kick it out, hear you shout. Further the right. Further the right. Further the right. Of all of creation. Power at first to the needs of each others' days. Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways. All unaccounted for in the craziness of power. In the craziness. Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother. Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister. Release, release. Release, release. Release, release. Release, release."
rhythm of love,"Innocence no answer. To your breaking heart. If the situation. Sometimes falls apart. Then in this ecstasy. Your charms are frozen. No emotion falling through your arms. Morning, daydream, time still growing shorter. Take me over lead me to the water. To the rhythm of love. The rhythm of love. The rhythm of love. Why should I escort you. To your secret needs. Climbing up your ladder. I keep falling down. Anyway will do. Anyone will do. When you dance to your darkest tune. Surrounded. As you crawl around the room. Night time fever burning till you're higher. Take me over lead me through the fire. The rhythm of love. To the rhythm of love. The rhythm of love. To the rhythm of love. Morning daydream midnight fever. Morning daydream midnight fever. Inhibitions keep you from your point of view. Information needing to confuse. In this situation I have found you. In the rhythm of. Morning daydream midnight fever. Morning daydream midnight fever. Rhythm of love. Rhythm of love. To the rhythm of love. Rhythm of love."
richard,"Richard set to sail the seven seas. With the power held within him he could feel the need. To reach out far and touch on all who came. To the resting place named Overon where he hath been. There you are. Take care my love. I'll be thinking all about you. With the morning stars. There you are. Take care my love. I'll be thinking all about you. With the morning stars. Richard fought the seven wars of old. As around him his foot soldiers cheered with hearts of gold. He rode amongst them shouting for the king. Didn't stop to think of ages past where he hath been. There you are. Take care my love. I'll be thinking of the time we shared. Amid the morning stars. There you are. Take care my love. I'll be thinking of the time we shared. Amid the morning stars. Richard never scaled to higher dreams. If a leader has it in for you, can you succeed. And though his passion kept us all afloat. There's no room for a deciever in the union boat. There you are. Take care my love. I'll singing songs about you. Til the morning, til the morning comes along. Richard dreamt of seeing but believed. In the gathering light a paradise he once concieved. To carry forth along the seven seas. With the light to a tree of Overon he set us free"
ritual (nous sommes du soleil),"Nous sommes du soleil.... We love when we play.... Open doors we find our way. We look, we see, we smile. Surely daybreaks cross our path. And stay maybe a while. Let them run, let them chase. Let them hide between. Constant doors will open eyes. As life seems like, life seems like a. Fight, fight, fight. Maybe I'll just sing awhile. And then give you a call. Maybe I'll just say hello. And say maybe that's all. Hurry home as love is true. Will help us through the night. Till we're coming home again. Our life seems like, life seems like a. Fight, fight, fight. Catch as we look and use the passions that flow. As we try we continue. We recieve all we venture to give. Maybe we'll just stand awhile. And surely we can call. Dreams are said to blossom courage. Constant to the soul. Change we must as surely time does. Changes call the course. Held inside we enter daybreaks. Asking for, asking for. The source, the source, the source, the source. Sent as we sing our music's total retain. As we try and consider. We receive all we venture to give. All we say is our soul constant sight listener. We won't tender our song clearer till we sail. Then I will be there. And I will be there. As clearer companions shall call to be near you. They move around telling me that. Move around surely sing. As they don't seem to matter at all. At all, at all, at all................................. Hold me my love, hold me today, call me round. Travel we say, wander we choose love tune. Lay upon me, hold me arund lasting hours. We love when we play. We hear a sound and alter our returning. We drift the shadows and course our way back home. Flying home, going home. Look me my love, sentences move dancing away. We join, we receive. As our song memories long hope in away. Nous sommes du soleil. Hold me around lasting hours. We love when we play. Nous sommes du soleil. Nous sommes du soleil. Nous sommes du soleil. Nous sommes du soleil."
roundabout,I'll be the round about. The words will make you out 'n' out. I spend the day your way. Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley. The muses dance and sing. They make the children really ring. I spend the day your way. Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley. In and around the lake. Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there. One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you. Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too. Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you. I will remember you. Your silhouette will charge the view. Of distance atmosphere.

run through the light,I asked my love to give me shelter. And all she offered me were dreams. Of all the moments spent together. That move like never ending streams.. Run to the light. Everything is alright. Run thro' the light of day. You run to the light of night. And every movement made together. Till every thought was just the same. And all the pieces fit forever. In the game.. Welcome to the light. Now everything is okay. Run thro' the light of night. You run to the light of day..
run with the fox,"Now the season, Now the question. Time to breathe a moment's grace. For the Hunter and the Hunted. Taking time to break the pace. Are you hopeful? Are you haunted. By the ghost of Christmas Past?. Face the future undaunted. Step aside or take your chance. Run with the Fox. Into the wind. Unto the dawn of tomorrow. Run with the Fox. Into the wild. Into the wild in the fold. Beware of the rocks. And be prepared. Prepare for love comes and goes. Run with the Fox. Every year the revolution. One more lost before begun. While we fight our mass confusion. Thus we walk before we run. Run with the Fox. Into the wind. Onto the dawn of tomorrow. Run with the Fox. Into the wild. Into the wild in the cold. Beware of the rocks. And be prepared. Prepare, for love finally grows. Ahh... Ahh... Ahhh..... Let us live to tell a story. Here on Earth and out in Space. Foreward on the road to glory. History records the chase. Have yourselves that certain Christmas. Eat, be glad, and drink the wine. Leave your sadness by the river. Giving love and given time.. Ahh... Ahhh.... Across the ice of frozen lakes. Run with the Fox. Along the lanes a lover takes. Run with the Fox. Beneath a moon, a Christmas moon. Run with the Fox. And sing a tune, a dreamer's tune. Run with the Fox. Across the bridge of many ways. Run with the Fox. Onto the place where dreamers bathe. Run with the Fox. Beneath a moon, a Christmas moon. Run with the Fox."
saving my heart,"In the street where we live there's a place called desire. There's a stone cold intrusion of mad man's fire. That he leaves when the lust and desire released. And you left with an empty room in peace. Chorus:. Saving my heart for you. You do what you wanna do. There's a place in my heart for you. This time I'm watching you. 'Till the blood in my veins run dry. I'll be there to testify. There's a place in my heart for you. I've been lost in a maze of emotional compound. I believe that you knew that our faith was secure. How you kept to be smile with the cool disposition. How you stuck in the fire with a new sense of reason. Chorus. You tell me ""Take it easy"". but it's not my style. something around the corner. It'll pass you by. I wanna hold you closer. to connect my fortunes. I wanna take you higher. take it out like you did before. Chorus. Chorus."

shoot high aim low,"We hit the blue fields. In the blue sedan we didn't get much further. Just as the sun was rising in the mist. We were all alone we didn't need much more. So fast this expidition. So vast this heavy load. With a touch of luck and a sense of need. Seeing the guns and their faces. We look around the open shore. Waiting for something. Shoot high break low. Aim high shoot low. Break high let go. Shoot high aim low. This was to be our last ride. With the steel guitar and the love you give me. Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown. Well we sat for hours on the crimson sand. Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold. And the leaders seem to lose control. Shall we lose ourselves for a reason. Shall we burn ourselves for the answer. Have we found the place that we're looking for. Someone shouted ""open the door"". Lookout. Shoot high break low. Aim high shoot low. Feeling of imagination. Break high let go. Shoot high aim low. Shoot high aim low. Nothing you can say. Shoot high let go. Takes me by surprise. Shoot high aim low. Who says's there's got to be a reason. Shoot high let go. Who says there's got to be an answer. We were all alone, we didn't need much more. Shoot high aim low. The sun's so hard on this endless highway. Shoot high let go. Shoot high aim low. I've heard the singers, who sing of love. Shoot high let go. In the blue sedan we never got much further. Shoot high aim low."
show me,"Show me the man who is lost in the forces of love. Show me the man who’s sad dreams just wont fade away. Show me the doors where I don’t understand what it is. I would show you a man who is lonely. I would show you a man who is lost and afraid. Show me the children who remember their own father now. Show me the children who just don’t sleep anymore. Show me the days where I don’t understand what it is. I would show you a child who is lonely. I would show you a child who is lost and afraid. Everybody seems to loose their sense in what the believe in. Misunderstanding what is true. Any one in love can realize that all you need. Is to be good to yourself. To be good to yourself. Show me a world without life, without hope anymore. Show me the days we’ve forgotten all the songs that we sing. Today is the day I can see what it’s all really for. I would show you a man he would dance for love. I would show you a man he would love to love. I would show you a man he would dance for love!. I would show you a man he would love to love!. I would show you a child who has everything. I would show you a child who has everything. I would show you a child who has everything. I would show you a child who has everything…"

soft as a dove,"Anderson/Howe/Squire/White. September 11, 2001. Soft as a dove. Touching the hand that lays next to me. Innocent light. Leading us through a moment in time. Then you came home. I let you cry like a father should do. Innocent light. Leading us to a moment in time. Soft as a dove. Touching the hand that lays next to me. Innocent light. Leading us through this moment in time. Thoughts run away. Youâ€™re overcome by a flood of believing. Just like a dove youâ€™re flying away. Everything beautiful coming your way. Everything beautiful coming your way."
"somehow, someday",So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars. In the moonlight we prays for forgiveness that's ours. Only now can she rest from the singing of songs. And the freedom of love. Chances are when you give the love you have. You will find it coming right back. Giving into the love. You know it's right. It's a feeling you'll long remember. Hearts will be chosen. Somehow. Someday. Hearts will be chosen. Sailing into the dreams of what could be. Reaching out for some form of contact. Waiting for the one you know is right. All you're needing to do. Surrender. Someday. Hearts will be chosen. Somehow. Someday. Hearts will be chosen. So many times on the clouds of forgiveness. We walk through the country and feel so at ease. A gentle reminder how things really are. In the homelands of love. Face to face with the one you really love. Moving forward down the right track. Chances are when you give all that you have. You will find it flooding right back. Someday. Hearts will be chosen. Somehow. Someday. Hearts will be chosen. O'er the green mountains and o'er the green valleys. The bluebird of faith sails far off to the shore. She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love. For the homelands of Ireland. So many times on the clouds of forgiveness. We walk through the country and feel so at ease. A gentle reminder how things really are. In the homelands of love. So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars. In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours. Only now can she rest from the singing of songs. And the freedom of love.

Something*s coming. Something good. If I can wait. Something*s coming. I don*t know what it is. But it is. Going to be great. With a click. With a shock. Bell will jingle. Door will knock.

The sun will lead us. Our reason to be here"
sound chaser,"Faster moments spent spread tales of change within the sound. Counting form through rhythm electric freedom. Moves to counter-balance stars expound our conscience. All to know and see the look in your eyes. Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene. New encounters spark a true fruition. Guiding lines we touch them, our bodies balance out the waves. As we accelerate our days to the look in your eyes. From the moment I reached out to hold, I felt a sound. And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds. And to know that tempo will continue. Lost in trance of dances as rhythm takes another turn. As is my want, I only reach to look in your eyes."
south side of the sky,(Jon Anderson/Chris Squire). A river a mountain to be crossed. The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost. Around the south side so cold that we cried. Were we ever colder on that day a million. Miles away. It seemed from all eternity. Move forward was my friend's only cry. In deeper to somewhere we could lie. And rest forthe the day with cold in the way. Were we ever colder on that day a million. Miles away. It seemed from all eternity. The moments seemed lost in all the noise. A snow storm a stimulating voice. Of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die. Were we ever warmer on that day a million. Miles away. We seemed from all eternity. The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost. The river can disregard the cost. And melt in the sky warmth when you die. Were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away. We seemed from all of eternity
spirit of survival,"Anderson/Howe/Squire/White. September 11, 2001. In this world the gods have lost their way. Canâ€™t keep this picture from out of my mind. This fear hand in hand crossing innocence, time. Surrounding creation they caught in a trap. The youngest offenders will witness confusion. They driving so fast not a care in the end. Escaping collision every twist every bend. When youâ€™re young invincible nothing to lose. Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle. The gods have forgotten to switch on the light. Whoâ€™s lost in the dark will crash in the night. These lessons weâ€™re living the lies of the day. Expect them to honor and never disobey. Yet greed is controlling the elders display. No wonder the younger look at them in shame. The spirit of survival. Whoâ€™s teaching the hatred. The spirit of survival. Or the class of your school. The spirit of survival. The color of your money. Weâ€™re standing in a circle. We donâ€™t understand at all. They donâ€™t understand at all. In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place. In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place. The younger the older the wiser become. Recover misfortune this true life as one. Our genius is shining the past has all gone. Whatâ€™s left is the clearest perception of one. The spirit of survival. To magnify the power. The spirit of survival. To magnify the soul. The spirit of survival. To magnify the love. Weâ€™re standing in a circle. We donâ€™t understand at all. We donâ€™t understand at all. In this world the gods have lost their way. In this world the gods have lost their way."

survival,"(Anderson). Sunshine is creeping in. And somewhere in a field a life begins. An egg too proud to rape. The beginning of a shape of things to come. That starts the run. Life has begun. Fly fast the gun. The mother flew too late. And life within the egg was left to fate. Not really knowing how. The world outside would take it when it came. And life*s the same. For things we aim. Are we to blame?. Don*t doubt the fact there*s life within you. Yesterday*s endings will tomorrow life give you. All that dies. Dies for a reason. To put its strength into the seasons. Survival,. Survival. They take away and they give. The living*s right to live (its all that we need to give). The living*s right to know. The egg breaks all is out. The crawling bird begins to scream and shout. Where is the parent bird?. A loneliness arose and heard its name -- ring in. For lives, begin. Survival win. Survival sin. So soon the evening comes. And with it runs the aching fear of hate. Could someone still remain. Who thinks he still could gain by escaping fate?. It*s much too late. Don*t underrate. Appreciate. Don*t doubt the fact there*s life within you. Yesterday*s endings will tomorrow life give you. All that dies. Dies for a reason. To put its strength into the seasons. Survival,. Survival. They take away and they give. The living*s right to live (its all that we need to give). The living*s right to know. Survival,. Survival. They take away and they give. The living*s right to live (its all that we need to give).

sweetness,"She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon. She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon. She watches for my moods and never brings me down. She puts the sweetness in all around. She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside. And when I'm all alone I feel I don't wanna hide. Today she brought me in and told me where she'd been. She put my mind at rest and put the sweetness in. I'll ask her for some time to go and look around. She puts the sweetness in with a sound. She knows just what to say to make a sunny day. And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way. Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own. And nobody to hold, I just can't see the way. I'm so glad it's today. And you're here, you're here. She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon. She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon. She watches for all my moods and never brings me down. She puts the sweetness in all around. She knows just what to say to make a sunny day. And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way. Oh, how I need her so, I know she'll never never go. She'll never leave me, believe me. She'll never go."
take the water to the mountain,"Take the water to the mountain;. Take the river to the sea.. Let the forest be salvation. Long before it needs to be.. Take the water to the mountain;. Let your body flow upstream.. Let it cascade off your shoulders;. Be the body of your dreams.. Take the water to the mountain;. Let the sun shine on your ground.. You decide your every movement;. Let the water to the land.. Take the water to the mountain;. Cross the Great Divide of Love.. Give to Nature all you can give;. Let the Mother know your heart.. Take the water to the mountain;. Let's become alive again.. Holy water, holy mountain,. Holy river, holy tree.. Pica!."
tango,"I just want to tell you everything. A quality of days of days of old. But the story has a sense of. Timelessnes and glory. 'Twas in the golden days of. At-witch Ord Icoloram. A lord of might, a king of justice. All in all, a gentle master. More I. A vision he had whilst fighting in a war. There appeared three angels of the sword. ""Bring out the living if you have. Bring out the hungry, let them feed. Bring out the blind and let them see. Bring out the soldiers of the free"". The lord of might Tiequitor. Began decision change of. Change within his court. Announced formation of the dead. >From all the wars they had been led. To rise and march. To rise and march. The lord of might Tiequitor Icoloram. Built forth an army in the spirit of men. The lord of might Tiequitor Icoloram. Built for the justice of millions that have died. In the wars gone by. Ten million arose. And came from all the battlefields. In ten thousand wars that had been fought. Bringing forth a multitude of hosts. Astride a white horse. A ghost, the Reaper, shine in viscious fright. Oh Reaper, king of night. Better they rode and charged down the graves. At the flight of the insane. As one, over land they plundered. This ghastly army has ever proclaimed. Ghost of Intrencha Iportia. Have you the ways and had you the gleam. The day was to come. The day was to come. It was to come reckoning. The day of judgement was at hand. As it will be, so it will be. The lord of might Tiequitor Icoloram. Built forth the army in the spirit of men. This day the fate of man. Let no man put asunder. All things will pass. And peace will win forever. The lord of might Tiequitor Icoloram. Built forth an army in the spirit of men. Days gone by, days gone by. So that day, the ancient of times. Appeared and spread, as answers divide. Lo! it passed, as all in one accord now. change, torn with the lore. No more words. My tears. Were Tears Of Joy"
teakbois,@SONG: The Life And Times Of Bobby Dread. (Anderson / Howe / Wakeman / Bruford). Jump out this next world. Is gone overground. That sky is ecstasy dancin'. My child my woman. My daughter my son. Together planning to party. Just wait for me. Out in the street. Teakbois in everywhere. Dancing with you. We're coming thru. Somehow we'll all be there. This time is surely. Come once and for all. We've waited so now. We are ready. Be quick be ready. Be sure and be smart. No need the energy wasted. I've dreamed of music. That comes from the heart. As tho' the eagle has landed. Just wait for me. Out in the street. Teakbois is everywhere. Dancing with you. We're coming thru. Everyone will be there. She smiles my mind. Is just blown I can't stop. No time is better than now. I wake up everyday. Before the sun is coming up. Bobby Dread and the kool running. The fish to catch. The sea to swim. They say I gotta life. To live. Bobby Dread and the kool running. My music is my only witness. To my very soul. Bobby Dread and the kool running. So when you need me. All you have to do is help me. Lose control.

Bobby Dread and the kool running. This summer you couldn't get it.
tempus fugit,"Born in the night. She would run like a leopard. That freaks at the sight. Of a mind close beside herself. And the nearer I came. How the country would change. She was using the landscape. To hide herself.. More in the mind. Than the body this feeling. A sense at the end. Of a circular line. That is drawn at an angle. I see when I'm with you. To navigate waters and finally answer to-yes.. If you were there you would want to be near me. Innocence, you could hold all the materials. And though nothing would really be living. It would shock Your fall into landing light. In the north sky time flies fast to the morning. The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us. You were keeping your best situation. An answer to-yes. (Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you. (Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you. (Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me. (Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you. (Yes, Yes) From the moment you tell me - yes. If you could see all the roads I have travelled. Towards some unusable last equilibrium. Run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speed-freak. An answer to all of your answers to-yes. In the north sky time flies faster than morning. The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us. You were keeping your best situation. An answer to Yes. (Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you. (Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you. (Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me. (Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you. (Yes, Yes) If we wait for an answer. (Yes, Yes) Will the silence be broken. (Yes, Yes) Should we wait for an answer. (Yes, Yes) Do we leave it unspoken. (Yes Yes Yes Yes . .)."
"that, that is","(Anderson/Howe/Squire/White). I.TOGETHERNESS (Instrumental). II.CROSSFIRE. Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all. the reasons lately. She took it out on God. and laid her soul to hell. and let the baby die. Julie's child was born. without a need or a reason for being. She took it as a message. from a real and a distant life. Shirley gets to help her with the child. though she's strung out on crack time. Shirley never knew. what it was to be held in real love. Together getting high. to get to mess up their night. Anything to get up. so they're losing their mind. Just to get high,. breaking out from this life,. gotta get them a drug to get. higher. Julie gets to walking out and drags. the child, says ""come on"". How we'll walk in the dark of morning. Cars screaming round the corner,. drugged to heaven, guns are loaded,. locked in vengeance. Who shoots the child?. Watching in the ghetto. is the spine and the cruel of the gang life. Sign language of the get go. you get in the gang life. Fear the only law,. fear is all we hear about,. Feed us in tha raw,. fear is all we fear about,. Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up. It's the answer to punishement given you. Don't give us reasons,. Caught i the crossfire dying. God give us reasons,. Don't give a reason,. God give a reason. Why lay dead a child's life?. III.THE GIVING THINGS. That talk is just a worry. and a worry in a man. That life is just a worrying. and getting in a mess. That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him. The pleasure of the giving things within. This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne. And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal. IV.THAT IS. That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man. That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess. That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him. The pleasure of the giving things within. That word is in it, that talk is in it. This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne. And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal. That beat is of the wanting of the where you're going. That street talk is the basis of the push and shove. They never told you that you have the right. The spirit of the angel, angels sing ""Shaava, shava, shava.. Shaava"". They be waiting for you, they be asking for you. We depending on you, we depending on the healing of the structure centre. Until you reach and touch your own redemption. They never give you a reason, they never give you a reason. They never give you a, give you a, give you a, give you a reason. V.ALL IN ALL. All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free. Watching for the signals that some easily. Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are. Every step a step to set you free. All for the sake and the calling of light. Ask as you give, as you measure in time. All in all this will to give, this sacrament, this need to live. Take it a step to bring love easily. All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free. Waiting for the waiting to be free. Talk is the easy end, everyone heard. Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can. This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting. This day is of a special way of love relating. This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to. make you. Wonder. How did heaven begin?. This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it,. When you see, you get it. All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free. Take it as it comes so easily. We'll be there beside the sign, the wherewithal, this will to be,. Bringing all the love that's meant to be. All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there. All in all this time is meant to be. VI.HOW DID HEAVEN BEGIN. These days are just a worry to the children of the world. These days are just a worry to the children of the world. How did heaven begin?. How did heaven begin?. VII.AGREE TO AGREE. Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure. Asking for the level where a world divides its answers. To the gang lords of evil life, they can't show you how. Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting. There is a reason for this being. Look upon this place as just a part of all that is. It is a spiritual part of being. Live with the power, you can be the strength it is. Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is. To give, to live, this hope, comes through,. It takes the trust to agree this agreement. Live for the breaking free. Live for the breaknig freedom. Just let it come through come through"
the 'ancient' (giants under the sun),"As one with the knowledge and magic of the source. Attuned to the majesty of music. They marched as one with the Earth. Sol, Dhoop. Sun. Ilios. Naytheet. Ah Kin. Saule. Tonatiuh. Qurax. Gunes, Grian. Surie. Ir. Samse. So the flowering creativity of life. Wove its web face to face with the shallow. And their gods sought out and conquered. Ah Kin. Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn. Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white. Does a shadow come between us in the winter. Is the movement really light. And I heard a million voices singing. Acting to the story that they had heard about. Does one child know the secret and can say it. Or does it all come out along without you. Along without you, along without you. Where does reason stop and killing just take over. Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead. Are there many more in comfort understanding. Is the movement in the head. And I heard a million voices singing. Acting to the story that they had heard about. Does one child know the secret and can say it. Or does it all come out alnog without you. Along without you, along without you."
the calling,(Trevor Rabin/Jon Anderson/Chris Squire). Feel the calling of a miracle. In the presence of the word. Now we hold the right to rearrange. How the stories can be heard. In the beginning is the future. And the future is at hand. I'll be calling voices of Africa. Be the rhythm to the plan. From the Congo to Lenasia. Be the writing on the wall. I'll be calling the colors of India. See the Asian life explode. Chorus. Head into the headlight. Don't turn from the rain. There's a fire raging somewhere near. Like a longtime friend who's. Seen it darker than ebony. Take off on the turnpike. (Asking for the first call). Give me more of the same. (Asking for a song). There's a fire burning in my heart again. I'll be calling the dragons of China. See the dancers of the Nile. See the wings of change are on display. This revelation mine. Feel the calling of the miracle. In the presence of the word. Chorus. Feel the calling of a miracle. The revelation mine
the game,"We all know the rules, the game. Us fools, still we play the same. As if our days remain. Our lives, the end will validate. It's more to do than to say. The love we gave along the way. Through fleeting days and all that greys. It's times like these as true love stays. I always knew through thick and thin. It's here that I'd begin again. I'm standing here. At your door. With all my defenses down. We all know the rules, the game. Us fools, still we play the same. As if our days remain. Our lives, the end will validate. It's more to do than to say. What we gave along the way. The big picture we now engage. Our scenes here set on the stage terrestrial. Reversing the flow. Here to grow. We're all rehearsing, you know. Come the final fade out. We all know the rules, the game. Us fools, still we play the same. As if our days remain. Our lives, the end will validate. It's more to do than to say. What we gave along the way. Through Fleeting days and all that greys. It's times like these as true love stays. I always knew through thick and thin. It's here that I'd begin again. I'm standing here. At your door.

the gates of delirium,"Stand and fight, we do consider. Reminded of an inner pact between us, that's seen as we go. And ride there, in motion. To fields in depth of honour, defending. Stand the marchers soaring talons. Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom, fighting we know. Destroy oppression, the point to reaction. As leaders look to you, attacking. Choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor. Kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow. Casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force. To alter via the war that's seen, as friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem. Wars that shout in screams of anguish. Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver, surely we know. In glory we rise to offer. Create our freedom, a word we utter. A word. Words cause our banner, victorious our day. Will silence be promised as violence displays. The curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day. Our gods awake in thunderous roars and guide the Leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause. Listen, should we fight forever. Knowing as we do know, fear destroys. Listen, should we leave our children. Listen, our lives stare in silence. Help us now. Listen, your friends have been broken. They tell us of your poison, now we know. Kill them, give them as they give us. Slay them, burn their children's laughter. On to hell. The fist will run, grasp metal to gun. The spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum. Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn. The pen won't stay the demon's wings. The hour approaches, pounding out the Devil's sermon. . Soon, oh soon the light. Pass within and soothe this endless night. And wait here for you. Our reason to be here. Soon, oh soon the time. All we move to gain will reach and calm. Our heart is open. Our reason to be here. Long ago, set into rhyme. Soon, oh soon the light. Ours to shape for all time, ours the right. The sun will lead us. Our reason to be here. Soon, oh soon the light. Ours to shape for all time, ours the right. The sun will lead us. Our reason to be here."
the giving things,That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man. That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess. That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him. The pleasure of the giving things within. This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne. And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal.

the messenger,"Anderson/Squire/Howe/White/Sherwood/Khoroshev. Judging by the voice. He was free to himself so real. We slaved ourselves to sacrifice. More than that we do not know. Then you hear him on the radio. He would play the sacred themes. That my children sang to me. Amazing as it seems. It was the answer to my dream. His heart that touches me. More than that I do not not know. Then I hear him on the radio. Remembering his every word. That my children sing to me. We have seen the world, this ecstasy. Now my children sing to me. This loving place, beyond belief. You got to stand stand to to together. Keep the message alive. You got to stand stand to to together. To keep the message alive. Spirit up moving, spirit up. Rhythm of sunfire. You got to stand stand to to together. Keep the message alive. Listening for his words. He would speak in ancient verse. So we mesmerize a way to go. Reaching out the universe. Reaching out the universal. Not afraid to learn new words. That our children sing to us. We have seen the world, this ecstasy. So his children bring to us. This inner peace, beyond belief. You got to stand stand to to together. Keep the message alive. You got to stand stand to to together. To keep the message alive. Spirit up moving, spirit up. Rhythm of sunfire. You got to stand stand to to together. Keep the message alive. One voice. One world. One touch. One life... truly, truly say it. One world... one voice. One touch... truly, truly say it. Some people realise. Some people see it. From the beginning. One world... one touch. One voice... one life. One touch... one voice... one world... one life."
the more we live - let go,"(Squire). You and I can change the world;. The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.. From this moment on we share the world;. The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.. The spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark;. The more we see, the more we try, the more we show.. The evidence of our confusion, life has left its mark;. The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.. As we walk into tomorrow. (Turning away from the path we know). Holding the future with our hands. (We carry the weight of the world we go). It's up to you and I -- We hold the key; we hold the answers. All our thoughts of doubt and fear are leaving one by one. The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.. For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun;. The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.. It's time to reach the goals we've set for ourselves;. The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.. All we need is just to believe in ourselves;. We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise.. Cast away our doubt and sorrow. (Turning away from the past we know). The Universe at our command. (Conserving the fate of the world we grow). Together you and I, we hold the key to all the answers. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go."
the one,"Never underestimate the loving. How we intertwine our very soul. How we fill eachother's spaces. To lose control. When you're talking be the children. Who stand on solid ground. Never underestimate the giving. That will bring you round. I'll be there. To bring you this love in the morning. I'll be there. To bring you the stars at night. I'll be there just waiting to hear you singing. Never underestimate a giver. The gift of love will surely be. When you're asking for the secret. To set you free. When you're talking to the friendship. That love of higher self. This gift of love is. The answer to all your doubts. Be the one, giving in to love. Never let the good in life desert you. Be the one, giving in to love. Never let the fools destroy your dreams. Be the one, giving in to love. I can dream myself every minute. So how did we become. Masters of limitation?. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. To make it right for you. Giving in, giving in to love. It's the balance of this everyday feeling. Giving in, giving in to love. Without love our dreams become illusion. Giving in, giving in to love. I can hear you singing every minute. So you can sing the song, and see the truth."
the prophet,"(Anderson/Squire). Long ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday,. Searching for the truth to life and not for just a way.. Finding pleasure from this house his ears, they did obey;. In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay.. He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning;. Seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed.. Words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life;. Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive.. Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself;. Asking not for pers'nal meaning, more for just himself.. Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living;. Take the things you need in life but remember the giving.. Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out;. Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt.. Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do;. Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you.."
the remembering (high the memory),"As the silence of seasons on. We relive abridge sails afloat. As to call light the soul shall sing. Of the velvet sailors course on. Of the velvet sailors course on. Shine or moons send me memories trail. Oer days of forgotten tales. Course the compass to offer. Into a time that we've all seen on. Into a time that we've all seen on. High the memory carry on. While the moments start to linger. Sail away among your dreams. The strength regains us in between our time. The strength regains us in between our time. As we shall speak to differ also. The ends meet the river's son. So the ends meet the river's son. Ours the story shall we carry on. And search the forest of the sun. We dream as we dream, dream as one. And I do think very well that the son might take you silently. They move fast, they tell me. There's someone, rainbow. Alternate tune. In the days of summer so long. We danced as evening sang their song. We wander out the day so long. And I do feel very well that the evenings take you silently. They move round, sunlight. Seeing ground. Whispers of clay, alternate ways. Softer messages bringing light. To a truth long forgotten on. As we shall speak to differ also. The ends meet the river's son. So the ends meet the river's son. I reach over and the fruit of life stands still. Stand awhile we search our past anew. The music sings of love you knew. We walk around the story. Out in the city running free. Sands of companions sides that be. The strength of the meeting lies with you. Wait all the more regard your past. Schoolgates remind us of our class. Chase all confusion away with us. Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays. Pass amongst your memories told returnig ways. As certain as we walk today. We walk around the story. Out in the city running free. Days pass as seconds turn the key. The strength of the moment lies with you. Don the cap and close your eyes. Imagine all the glorious challenge. Iron metal cast to others. Distant drums. Force the bit betwenn the mouth of freedom. Didn't we learn to fly. Remember to sail the skies. Distant suns. Will we reach. Winds allow. Other skylines. Other skylines to hold you. Relayer, all the dying cried before you. Relayer, we've rejoiced in all their meaning. Relayer, we advance, we retrace our stories. Like a dreamer all our lives. Are only lost begotten changes. We relive in seagull's pages. Outward ways. Things are all in colours. And the size of others shall send you forward. Arranged to sail you toward. A peace of mind. Will we reach. Winds allow. Other skylines. Other skylines to hold you. Relayer, all the passion spent on one cross. Relayer, sail the futile wars they suffer. Relayer, we advance, we retrace our story. Fail safe now. Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays. Pass amongst your memories told returning ways. As certain as we walk today. Press over moments leaving you. Out in the city runnig free. Days pass as seconds turn the key. The strength of the moment lies with you. Out tender outward lights of you. Shine over mountains make the view. The strength of you seeing lies with you. Ours entrance we surely carry on. And change the passing as the sun. We don't even need to try, we are one. And I do think very well as the truth unfolds you silently. They move time, rainbows. Sunlight. Alternate tune, alternate tune. Rainbows, soft light. Alternate view. Sunlight tell me. Someone. Alternate view. Alternate view. Surely, surely."
the revealing science of god (dance of the dawn),"Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources. Chased amid fusions of wonder. In moments hardly seen forgotten. Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge. Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole. Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days undersearching earth. Revealing corridors of time provoking memories. Disjointed but with purpose. Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp and tender love. As we took to the air a picture of distance. Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused expression. As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing late into corners. And we danced from the ocean. Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many wont to follow. Only tunes of a different age. As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting. Talk to the sunlight caller. Soft summer mover distance mine. Called out a tune but I never saw the face. Heard but not replaced. I ventured to talk but I never lost my place. Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day. Lost in lights array. I ventured to see as the sound began to play. What happened to this song we once knew so well. Signed promise for moments caught within the spell. I must have waited all my life for this. Moment moment. The future poised with the splendour just begun. The light we were as one. And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun. And for a moment when our world had filled the skies. Magic turned our eyes. To feast on the treasure set for our strange device. What happened to wonders we once knew so well. Did we forget what happened, surely we can tell. We must have waited all our lives for this. Moment moment moment. Starlight movement. Reasons. Release forward. Tallest rainbow. Sun shower seasons. Life flower reasons. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe that I can feel it. There's someone to tell you. Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you. Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest. Thoughts would send our fusion clearly to be home. Getting over wars we do not mean, or so it seems so clearly. Sheltered with our passion clearly to be home. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe they really mean to. There's someone to tell you. And I just can't believe our song will leave you. Skyline teacher. Warland seeker. Send out poison. Cast iron leader. And through the rhythm of moving slowly. Sent through the rhythm work out the story. Move over glory to sons of old fighters past. Young Christians see it from the beginning. Old people feel it, that's what they're saying. Move over glory to sons of old fighters past. They move fast, they tell me. But I just can't believe they really mean to. There's someone to tell you. A course towards a universal season. Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest. They might stand and leave them clearly to be home. Getting over wars they do not mean, we charm the movement suffers. Call out all our memories clearly to be home. We've moved fast, we need love. A part we offer is our only freedom. What happened to this song we once knew so well. Signed promise for moments caught within the spell. We must have waited all our lives for this. Moment moment. Past present movers moments we'll process the future,. But only through Him we know. Send flowered rainbows. A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs. To follow and show all we feel for and know of. Cast round. You seekers of the truth aceepting that reason will relive. And breathe and hope and chase and love. For you and you and you."

themes,i Sound. (Anderson / Howe / Wakeman / Bruford). Instrumental. ii Second Attention. (Anderson / Howe / Wakeman / Bruford). Be gone you ever piercing. Power Play machine. Cutting our musical solidarity. For those who would break the windows. Of our true reflections. And perceptions of the world. 'For I am out of thee with a vengeance'. Do not play me. You will never hear this. You will never hear this. Only feel it. For too long I have danced. To your destiny. No longer fill my head. With empty dreams. Of reality and gold. Your reality. For I am away this side away to the second attention. I can never ever play it or sing it. For it can never be shouted down. Or played every stronger. As I feel this never ending. Pattern of nature. I don't believe in Devils. I don't believe in Demons. I only believe in you. iii Soul Warrior. (Anderson / Howe / Wakeman / Bruford). Instrumental.
then,"(Anderson). And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.. Souls will be complicated, life will be consummated then.. Hearts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.. As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;. Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.. And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.. Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.. Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then.. Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.. Truth is just for the being and there's the sight for seeing then.. Thoughts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then..

time is time,"Time has saved as time has moved. Night has come at last to shine on you. Last night I looked inside the moon. And I knew you were real. So every time I look at you.

to be alive (hep yadda),"Anderson/Squire/Howe/White/Sherwood/Khoroshev. Not a lot is missing. Every ounce of treasure found. And I believe that everyone should get what. They're allowed. Suspected of belief that comes suspended. In a sound. And everybody wants some. It's the sound they make in heaven. It's a sound for here on earth. I've heard it in the whispering. Of the wonders that we search. We've waited far too long. To hear the healing of the stars. 'N' everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. To feel alive. Oh - does it get much better than this. Oh - does it get much better, much better. Oh - does it get much better than this, than this. There's the sound that keeps you trying. There's the sound that makes you smile. There's a sound in every corner. Of the world that we survive. Your temple is the harmony. You feel the sacred ground. Just wishing for the secret. To appear within the sound. Watching for the morning star. The rhythm of the sun. I hear it in my waking dreams. The singing has begun. The passion that we walk upon. The passion that we bring. Is written for the mountains. They love to hear us sing. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. Everybody wants some. To feel alive. Oh - doesn't get much better than this. Oh - doesn't get much better than this, than this. Who made me make believe. I'm alive I'm living. Never underestimate. The signals coming to you. Oh. The sounding of the earth. It shakes you, yes it shakes you. Oh. The sounding of the earth. It shakes you, let it shake you. Hep yadda."
to be over,We go sailing down the calming streams. Drifting endlessly by the bridge. To be over. We will see. To be over. Do not suffer through the game of chance that plays. Always doors to lock away your dreams. Think it over. Time will heal your fear. Think it over. Balance the thoughts that release within you. Childlike soul dreamer one journey. One to seek and see in ev'ry light do open. True pathways away. Carrying closer go gently. Holding doors will open everyway. You wander true pathways away. After all your soul will still surrender. After all don't doubt your part. Be ready to be loved

I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.. There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't. understand.. Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,. As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea.. There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will. be.. Down at the edge, close by a river.. Close to the edge, round by the corner.. Close to the end, down by the corner.. Down at the edge, round by the river.. Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory.. All in all, the journey takes you all the way.. As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.. Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,. Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.. As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.. Down at the edge, round by the corner.. Close to the end, down by a river.. Seasons will pass you by.. I get up, I get down."

turn of the century,"(Anderson,Howe,White). Realizing a form out of stone. Set hands moving. Roan shaped his heart. through his working hands. Work to mold his passion into clay, like the sun. In his room his lady. she would dance and sing so completely. So be still he now cries. I have time oh let clay transform thee so. In the deep cold of night. winter calls he cries Don't deny me. For his lady, deep her illness. Time has caught her. and will for all reasons take her. In the still light of dawn, she dies. Helpless hands soul revealing. Like leaves we touch we learn. We once knew the story. As winter calls he will starve. All but to see the stone be life. Now Roan, no more tears. Set to work his strength. So transformed him. realizing a form out of stone. His work so absorbed him. Could she hear him?. Could she see him?. All aglow was his room dazed in this light. He would touch her. he would hold her. Laughing as they danced. Highest colors touching others. Did her eyes at the turn of the century. tell me plainly. How we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me. Like leaves we touched we danced. We once knew the story. As autumn called and we both. remembered all those many years ago. I'm sure we know. Was the sign of the day with a touch. As I kiss your fingers. We walk hands in the sun. Memories when we're young. Love lingers so. Was it sun through the haze. that made all your looks. as warm as moonlight?. As a pearl deep your eyes. tears have flown away. all the same light. Did her eyes at the turn of the century. tell me plainly. when we meet how we'll look. as we smile time will leave me clearly. Like leaves we touch, we see. We will know the story. As autumn calls we'll both remember. all those many years ago."
universal garden,Looking up into the endless sky. Staring into the maze of time. Our existance caught in the blink of an eye. Imagining other words we try. Realizing somehow we're all part of this. Wondrous cosmical tapestry. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Starlight. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Looking up into the endless sky. Through space and time. Staring into the maze of time. We'll fly. Our existence caught in the blink of an eye. Retracing years. Imagining other worlds we try. No fears. Realizing somehow we're all part of this. Blazing a new trail. Wondrous cosmical tapestry. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Starlight. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Investigate the science of illusion. We benefit without knowing. Our time is man-made. Our fear is man-made. Delusion man-made. Religion man-made. Love is forever. Flowering. Endlessly through the universal garden. Garden above. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Wanting to know where it begins. The puzzle piece we are missing. Beyond the sun. Beyond the sky. Are where the real questions lie. Universal garden.
walls,"Don't you know it's my way out?. To be on my own. When I feel like crying out I do it best alone. Can you give me love and. Protection to shield my heart. All the fear I feel from doubt. Is tearing me apart. I wanna love, I wanna give. I want to find another way to live. Another shout, another cry. And the walls come tumbling down. Don't you know there's now way out. Your pain's your own. And the more we scream and shout. The more we feel alone. I can feel my anger rising. Am I to blame?. And I'm not gonna keep it inside me. Do you feel the same?. I wanna love, I wanna give. I want to find another way to live. Another shout, another cry. And the walls come tumbling down. And I'm calling you. Let me go. And I'm calling. I wanna love, I wanna give. I want to find another way to live. Another shout, another cry. And the walls come tumbling down. Oh, this indecision. Can break me down. Let it run to the river, tell me. Oh, this indecision. Can break me down. Let me run to the river, let me. Let me run to the river"
we agree,"Anderson/Howe/Squire/White. September 11, 2001. Answers never clear again. This turning of the page. This turn look away. There I took a left turning. Before I came of age. I agreed to let it out. I agreed to let it go. I agreed to turn around. I agreed to turn my face away. Danger is the most important. Fear youll ever know. The transporting of refugees. The silent night is cold. And all the time. We looked around. As we were never told. But we agreed to let it out. We agreed to let it go. We agreed to turn our backs. We agreed to turn our face away, away. Thousands to the million. Sisters, grandmothers and more. Its not the feast we throw away. Its the way we close the door. Their silence deafens every sound. We try just to ignore. To waste their future freedom. Well regret forever more. I believe in. I believe in. These are the days that we will talk about. I believe in. I believe in. One understanding what is real. If we are one. Then we are refugees. We are the prisoners of our own design. If we are one. Seen through the eyes of a child. We will perpetuate this song of love. If we are one. Seen through the eyes of a child. We will perpetuate this song of love. If we are one. Seen through the eyes of a child. We will perpetuate this song. Perpetuate this song of love. Now we build the bridges. That we walk upon together. At the last count many lonely souls. The sadness always kills. Each breaking point is waiting. For the promise to fulfill. When we agree to turn the page. When we agree to help them free. When we agree to let it out. When we agree to let it shine. When we agree to let it run. When we agree to let it change our lives. I believe in, our lives. I believe in, our lives. These are the days we will talk about. When we are one. Seen through the eyes of child. We will perpetuate this song of love. When we are one. Seen through the eyes of child. We will perpetuate this song of love. Song of love. Yeah, yeah, perpetuate this song of love. Seeing through the eyes of child. Seeing through the eyes of child"

where will you be,"(Trevor Rabin/Jon Anderson). Where will you be when you're not here. How many lives in this earth time. You are my soul and this you are. Two souls intertwined that's what we are. We can we walk hand in hand. All the life. Be the one everything to me. You I am dreaming. We have lived and known before I feel it. Where will you lie. When will I know. When you are gone. Where I be and I will miss you. We are this love in this life. Two souls intertwined like once before. See this meeting, hand in hand. Every life. Be the one everything to me. You are my feeling. No need to fear this love of life. We are the truth of every earth life. No need to fear this life at all. We are the sun and everlasting life. Where will you be hearing this song. How many lives in this earth time. You are my soul and this you are. You are my soul and this you are. Where will you be."
"without hope, you cannot start the day","Hold still now for the moving information close to you.. You could never force it in your life: this decision to break it.. Without hope, you cannot start the day.. It's coming clear I've noticed;. It's a different face you're showing.. It's another ""Welcome Back"".. I don't imagine it could be this way -- So jealous!. Only you can tell it; tell me why.. Only you call tell it.. Only you can say.. In between this moving out to save your soul it came away,. And took it out;. Oh why?. Fire burning wild, burning in the night, chasing in the wind;. Shadows always dance in the rain, ringing into the fire.. Doesn't matter who, who can see in the smile.. Hope in the rain, open the flame, coming back in the night.. I can see the rhythm of the rain; I can see it shout back under:. I can see what you're thinking of. I can see what you think you need. I can see what you're thinking of. I can see that it must be love. Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed;. Shake it off - Passion is the flame that fired.. Does it matter? Can you give? Can you hear it come?. Can you see you're like?. What's the matter? Don't you want to risk? Don't you want to hold me?. Hold me, dance in the rain.. I can see the love in your eyes; I can see you coming.. I can see what you're thinking of. I can see what you think you want. I can see what you're thinking of. I can see that it must be love. Sweet suffering, love protection: Need it, You need; Come to me.. Believe it, better by far, your heart is there;. Most of all: Believe it.. Perfection Reaction...."
wonderlove,I believed that one day love would cast a line. I believed there was something more for me to find. Hoping today. Hoping tomorrow. Taking it all in stride. I believed. I could be chasing my mind. There you were. Like a dream to me. Wonderlove. Could this really be. Wonderlove. Can I make you see. You're the world to me. I believe if only we could take the time. Eventually we would learn each other's life. Open your heart. Give it a moment. Leaving the cares behind. Happily. We could be two of a kind. There you were. Like a dream to me. Wonderlove. We were meant to be. Wonderlove. Can I make you see. You're the world to me. It was the very next day that I came alive. The door flung open. There was a vision. Couldn't believe my eyes. Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it. Everyone believing here at last receiving. Wonderlove. It's a place we all belong. Wonderlove. Wonderlove. Can I make you see. You're my world. I believe I could walk a thousand miles. Just to see the vision of your simple smile. Everyday. Wanting to follow. Forever by your side. Faithfully. You are my destiny. There you were. Wonderlove. We were meant to be. Wonderlove. It's the world where we belong. Wonderlove. Together we will faithfully. Wonderlove. Can I make you see. You're the world to me. Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to. If you're looking for the wisdom of the world. All you've got to do is let it coming through. Be forever. Just imagine. Wonderlove.
wonderous stories,"I awoke this morning. Love laid me down by the river. Drifting I turned on up stream. Bound for my forgiver. In the giving of my eyes to see your face. Sound did silence me. Leaving no trace. I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories. Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'La Aha'. He spoke of lands not far. Nor lands they were in his mind. Of fusion captured high. Where reason captured his time. In no time at all he took me to the gate. In haste I quickly. Checked the time. If I was late. I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories. Had to hear your wonderous stories 'La Aha, La Aha'. Hearing. Hearing hearing your wonderous stories. Hearing your wonderous stories. It is no lie I see deeply into the future. Imagine everything. You're close. And were you there. To stand so cautiously at first. And then so high. As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky. I bid it to return. To hear your wonderous stories. Return to hear your wonderous stories. Return to hear your wonderous stories. La Ah La Ah Ah Ah. Hearing. Hearing. Hearing. Hearing. Hearing"

yours is no disgrace,"Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face. Caesar's Palace, morning glory, silly human race. On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place.

Lost in summer, born in winter, travel very far. Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are. Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face. Caesar's Palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race. On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place. If the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace.
