sleeping sun,The sun is sleeping quietly. Once upon a century. Wistful oceans calm and red. Ardent caresses laid to rest. For my dreams I hold my life. For wishes I behold my night. The truth at the end of time. Losing faith makes a crime. I wish for this night-time. to last for a lifetime. the darkness around me. Shores of a solar sea. Oh how I wish to go down with the sun. Sleeping. Weeping. With you. Sorrow has a human heart. From my god it will depart. I'd sail before a thousand moons. Never finding where to go. Two hundred twenty-two days of light. Will be desired by a night. A moment for the poet's play. Until there's nothing left to say. I wish for this night-time.... I wish for this night-time.... nähräven

shudder before the beautiful,"The deepest solace lies in understanding,. This ancient unseen stream,. A shudder before the beautiful. Awake, oceanborn. Behold this force. Bring the outside in. Explode the self to epiphany. The very core of life. The soaring high of truth and light. The music of this awe. Deep silence between the notes. Deafens me with endless love. This vagrant Island Earth. A pilgrim shining bright. We are shuddering before the beautiful. Before the plentiful. We, the voyagers. Tales from the seas. Cathedral of green. The unknown, the grand show, the choir of the stars. Interstellar theatre play, the nebulae curtain falls. Imagination, evolution, a species from the vale. Walks in wonder in search of the source of the tale"
élan,"Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk,. In tongues from the time before a man. Listen to a daffodil tell her tale. Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn. The meadows of heaven await harvest. The cliffs unjump cold waters untouched. The elsewhere creatures yet unseen. Finally your number came up. free fall awaits the brave. Come. Taste the wine. Race the blind. They will guide you from the light. Writing noughts till the end of time. Come. Surf the clouds. Race the dark. It feeds from the runs undone. Meet me where the cliffs greets the sea. The answer to the riddle before your eyes. Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies. Returning swans and sedulous mice. Writings on the gardens book,. In the minute of a lover's look. Building a sandcastle close to the shore. A House of cards from the worn out deck. A home from the fellowship, poise and calm. Write a lyric for the song only you can understand. Riding hard every shooting star. Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox. Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep. Travel with great Élan, dance a jig at the funeral. Come!"

Drown into eyes while they're still blind. Love while the night still hides the withering dawn. First day of love never comes back. A passionate hour's never a wasted one. The violin, the poet's hand,. Every thawing heart plays your theme with care. Kiss while your lips are still red. While he's still silent. Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled.

walking in the air,We're walking in the air. We're floating in the moonlit sky. The people far below are sleeping as we fly. I'm holding very tight. I'm riding in the midnight blue. I'm finding I can fly so high above with you. Far across the world. The villages go by like trees. The rivers and the hills. The forests and the streams. Children gaze open mouth. Taken by surprise. Nobody down below believes their eyes. We're surffing in the air. We're swimming in the frozen sky. We're drifting over icy. Mountain floating by. Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep. Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep. We're walking in the air. We're floating in the midnight sky. And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly. I'm holding very tight. I'm riding in the midnight blue. I'm finding I can fly so high above with you
the islander,"An old man by a seashore. At the end of day. Gazes the horizon. With seawinds in his face. Tempest-tossed island. Seasons all the same. Anchorage unpainted. And a ship without a name. Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard. He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world. Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts. The ones on their travels homeward from afar. This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying. The tears he left behind long ago. The albatross is flying. Making him daydream. The time before he became. One of the world's unseen. Princess in the tower. Children in the fields. Life gave him it all:. An island of the universe. Now his love's a memory. A ghost in the fog. He sets the sails one last time. Saying farewell to the world. Anchor to the water. Seabed far below. Grass still in his feet. And a smile beneath his brow. This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying. The tears he left behind long ago. So long ago (2x). This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying.

ghost love score,"We used to swim the same moonlight waters. Oceans away from the wakeful day. My fall will be for you. My love will be in you. If you be the one to cut me. I`ll bleed forever. Scent of the sea before the waking of the world. Brings me to thee. Into the blue memory. My fall will be for you. My love will be in you. If you be the one to cut me. I will bleed forever. Into the blue memory. A siren from the deep came to me. Sang my name my longing. Still I write my songs about that dream of mine. Worth everything I may ever be. The Child will be born again. That siren carried him to me. First of them true loves. Singing on the shoulders of an angel. Without care for love n` loss. Bring me home or leave me be. My love in the dark heart of the night. I have lost the path before me. The one behind will lead me. Take me. Cure me. Kill me. Bring me home. Every way. Every day. Just another loop in the hangman`s noose. Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home. Every way, every day. I keep on watching us sleep. Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve. Of you and me. Forgive the adoring beast. Redeem me into childhood. Show me myself without the shell. Like the advent of May. I`ll be there when you say. Time to never hold our love. My fall will be for you. My love will be in you. You were the one to cut me. So I`ll bleed forever"
dark chest of wonders,Once I had a dream. And this is it. Once there was a child`s dream. One night the clock struck twelve. The window open wide. Once there was a child`s heart. The age I learned to fly. And took a step outside. Once I knew all the tales. It`s time to turn back time. Follow the pale moonlight. Once I wished for this night. Faith brought me here. It`s time to cut the rope and fly. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago. The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me. This night will bring him back to me. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago

storytime,"'Twas the night before. When all through the world. No words, no dreams, then one day. A writer by a fire. Imagined all Gaia. Took a journey into. A child-man's heart. A painter on the shore. Imagined all the world. Within a snowflake on his palm. Unframed by poetry. A canvas of awe. Planet Earth falling back into the stars. I am the voice of Never-Never-Land.

The flute from the realm unseen. Empties its heart. Making love to me. With its enchanting melody.. Light of Orion,. Shadow of Andromeda,. Call of the dancing Universe.. Their love I must enter. Before thou can blame my soul. That is peace"""

Never sigh for better world. It`s already composed, played and told. Every thought the music I write. Everything a wish for the night. Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin. Died for the beauty the one in the garden. Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom. Failed in becoming a god. Never sigh for better world. It`s already composed, played and told. Every thought the music I write. Everything a wish for the night. ""If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it. Remember only the verse, songmaker`s cry the one without tears. For I`ve given this its strength and it has become my only strength.. Comforting home, mother`s lap, chance for immortality. Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew. The sweet piano writing down my life"". ""Teach me passion for I fear it`s gone. Show me love, hold the lorn. So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me. I`m sorry. Time will tell (this bitter farewell). I live no more to shame nor me nor you. And you... I wish I didn`t feel for you anymore..."". A lonely soul... An ocean soul.... A lonely soul...

the carpenter,Who are you? Man condemned to shine a salvation. Throughout the centuries. Why? Was the wine of the grail. Too sour for man to drink. The carpenter. Carved his anchor. On the dying souls of mankind. On the tomb of this unknown soldier. Lay the tools of the one who for us had died. Tools of the carpenter. The one they lick. The same old sick. Dream of their precious saviour. Kiss them deep. And make them weep. Over promises of eternal peace. The carpenter.... I hear you. Through the symphonic voices of nature. The purity I could never doubt. They tell me to lie on the grass. And observe my saviour. The one crucified to the chirping of birds. The carpenter....

Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly’s wings. Where is the wonder where’s the awe. Where’s dear Alice knocking on the door. Where’s the trapdoor that takes me there. Where’s the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare. Where is the wonder where’s the awe. Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for. Before the years take me. I wish to see. The lost in me.

Beneath the lovely birch honeymakers build their nest in peace. On the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnu. To honor this moment even the heavens cease. Giant spiders learn how to swim. With whales they form a united kin. Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground. In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound. Trilobite & Anymalocharis. The prey and the hunter. Survival of the fittest. Fall of Man. Seadrops foam all empty human skulls. Those on the shores of Atlantis. Darwin's resurrection is witnessed. By turtles he used to play with. Healed and happy She oversees. The Mother. The tyrant's return to the sea.
alpenglow,"Once upon a time a song was heard. Giving birth to a child of earth and verse. Together we slay another fright. Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past. Close your eyes and take a peek. The truth is easy to see. We were here. Roaming on the endless prairie. Writing an endless story. Building a Walden of our own. We were here. Grieving the saddened faces. Conquering the darkest places. Time to rest now and to finish the show. And become the Music, one with alpenglow. Hand in hand guiding me into light. You, the fairytale guise in blue and white.

amaranth,"Baptised with a perfect name. The doubting one by heart. Alone without himself. War between him and the day. Need someone to blame. In the end, little he can do alone. You believe but what you see. You receive but what you give. Caress the one, the Never-Fading. Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow. Caress the one, the hiding amaranth. In a land of the daybreak. Apart from the wandering pack. In this brief flight of time we reach. For the ones, whoever dare. You believe but what you see. You receive but what you give. Caress the one, the Never-Fading. Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow. Caress the one, the hiding amaranth. In a land of the daybreak (2x).

angels fall first,An angelface smiles to me. Under a headline of tragedy. That smile used to give me warmth. Farewell - no words to say. Beside the cross on your grave. And those forever burning candles. Needed elsewhere. To remind us of the shortness of our time. Tears laid for them. Tears of love tears of fear. Bury my dreams dig up my sorrows. Oh Lord why. The angels fall first?. Not relieved by thoughts of Shangri-La. Nor enlightened by the lessons of Christ. I'll never understand the meaning of the right. Ignorance lead me into the light. Needed elsewhere.... Sing me a song. Of your beauty. Of your kingdom. Let the melodies of your harps. Caress those whom we still need. Yesterday we shook hands. My friend. Today a moonbeam lightens my path. My guardian

astral romance (1997),A nocturnal concerto. Candlelight whispers me where to go. Hymn of gathering stars as my guide. As I wander on this path of the night. Embroidery of the stars. Undress my feelings for this earth. Send me your salva to heal my scars. And let this nakedness me my birth. Macrocosm poured its powers on me. And the hopes of this world I now must leave. The nightwish I sent you centuries ago. Has been heard by those. Who dwelled in a woe. The distance of our bridal bed. Await for me to be dead. Dust of the galaxies take my hand. Lead me to my beloved's land. Departed by the guillotine of death. I received a letter from the depth. The dream of my lover it carried inside. Caressed by the sharpest knife. I asked you to be my wife. Rays of the setting sun. Were my tears wept upon promises undone. Come to me. Make me believe. to you and your love again. Above the universe. Beneath the Great Eye. I shall desire you forevermore. . (fonte: site oficial)

beauty and the beast,Remember the first dance we shared?. Recall the night you melted my ugliness away?. The night you left with a kiss so kind. Only a scent of beauty left behind. Ah dear friend I remember the night. The moon and the dreams we shared. Your trembling paw in my hand. Dreaming of that northern land. Touching me with a kiss of a beast. I know my dreams are made of you. Of you and only for you. Your ocean pulls me under. Your voice tears me asunder. Love me before the last petal falls. As a world without a glance. Of the ocean's fair expanse. Such the world would be. If no love did flow in thee. But as my heart is occupied. Your love for me now has to die. Forgive me I need more than you can offer me. Didn't you read the tale. Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?. Don't you know this tale. In which all I ever wanted. I'll never have. For who could ever learn to love a beast?. However cold the wind and rain. I'll be there to ease your pain. However cruel the mirrors of sin. Remember beauty is found within. ...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in. you.... . .

burning flames' embrace,"Ealking towards the night. The flames once burnt inside. Back then I was alive. When the fire walked by my side. The screaming fire burnt the leaves of mine. And left the ashes of divine. All the leaves contained my name. The shadows took them and carried away. Firewalk, I want to feel it again. Dance on the flames, does it feel the same?. Tears of blood they burn my face. I want to feel the burning flames' embrace. The cold night freezing up my sins. The memories of ice burn my skin. But I see the flames of gold dancing. And the last one of the leaves is still burning. Now all the ashes contain my name. I'm one with the dark, I've lost the flame. My unleashedthoughts flying to the distant land of dreams. And disappear in the sand. Firewalk, I want to feel it again. Emptiness has filled my heart. I see a blaze but it's much too far. I try to reach for it, it's calling my name. I know it's my fire with its warm embrace. Like a frozen flower covered with ice. My soul is cold and ready to die. This holy secret turned to a sacred lie. I followed it and lost my guide. Firewalk, I want to feel it agaïn"

crownless,Crownless again shall be the queen. Trophy on her grave remains unseen. A boat on the river confessing the sins. The Riddler revealing the deep hidden things. Crownless again shall be the king. A gull covered in oil with a broken wing. A hitcher on a road alone and lost. Iron sharpens iron - a truth that once was. Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone. Mine is the throne for the idol. One fleeting moment and it is all gone. Crownless again. Will I fall?. Roaming on razor-sharp castles.

Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone. Mine is the throne for the idol. One fleeting moment and it is all gone. Crownless again. Will I fall?
dark chest of wonders,Once I had a dream. And this is it. Once there was a child`s dream. One night the clock struck twelve. The window open wide. Once there was a child`s heart.

It`s time to cut the rope and fly. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago. The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me. This night will bring him back to me. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago. Fly to a dream. Far across the sea. All the burdens gone. Open the chest once more. Dark chest of wonders. Seen through the eyes. Of the one with pure heart. Once so long ago
dark sky,A star falls from the sky black. Where new worlds born and die. Animal kingdom assists its brightness approaching. What that means will be known soon. Below the manufacturers of honey from birch lovely build the nest them in peace. In a savannah lion licks a wounded gnu. To honor this moment even the heavens cease. Giant spiders learn to swim. With whales they form a family together. Snakes say hi to the rats on the floor. In the fields happily playing the fox and hound. Trilobites & anymalocharis. The prey and the hunter. Survival of the most prepared. Fall of a man. Seafoam in human skulls empty. Those in the back of Atlantis. The resurrection of Darwin is witnessed. For the turtles that he usually joking. Cured and happy she watches. The mother. The return of the tyrant of the sea
dead boy's poem,"""I live no more to shame nor me nor you. I'm sorry"". Born from silence, silenced full of it. Perfect concert my best friend. So much to live for, so much to die for.

Never sigh for better world. It`s already composed, played and told. Every thought the music I write. Everything a wish for the night. Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin.

Before the grandeur of it all. Our floating pale blue ark. Of endless forms most beautiful. Beyond aeons we take a ride. Welcoming the shrew that survived. To see the Tiktaalik take her first walk. Witness the birth of flight. Deeper down in Panthalassa. A eukaryote finds her way. We return to the very first one. Greet the one we?ll soon become"
escapist,"Who's there knocking at my window?. The Owl and the Dead Boy. This night whispers my name. All the dying children. Virgin snow beneath my feet. Painting the world in white. I tread the way and lose myself into a tale. Come hell or high water. My search will go on. Clayborn Voyage without an end. A nightingale in a golden cage. That's me locked inside reality's maze. Come someone make my heavy heart light. Come undone bring me back to life. It all starts with a lullaby. Journey homeward bound. A sound of a dolphin calling. Tearing off the mask of man. The Tower my sole guide. This is who I am. Escapist, paradise seeker. Farewell now time to fly. Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies. A nightingale in a golden cage. That's me locked inside reality's maze. Come someone make my heavy heart light. Come undone bring me back to life. It all starts with a lullaby. (Bonustrack). . (fonte: site oficial)"
eva,"6:30 winter morning. Snow keeps falling, silent dawn. A rose by any other name. Eva leaves her Swanbrook home. A kindest heart which always made. Me ashamed of my own. She walks alone but not without her name. Eva flies away. Dreams the world far away. In this cruel children's game. There's no friend to call her name. Eva sails away. Dreams the world far away. The Good in her will be my sunflower field. Mocked by man to depths of shame. Little girl with life ahead. For a memory of one kind word. She would stay among the beasts. Time for one more daring dream. Before her escape, edenbeam. We kill with her own loving heart. Eva flies away. Dreams the world far away. In this cruel children's game. There's no friend to call her name. Eva sails away. Dreams the world far away. The Good in her will be my sunflower field. . (fonte: site oficial)"

feel for you,"You were my first love. The earth moving under me. Bedroom scent, beauty ardent. Distant shiver, heaven sent. I'm the snow on your lips. The freezing taste, the silvery sip. I'm the breath on your hair. The endless nightmare, devil's lair. Only so many times. I can say I long for you. The lily among the thorns. The prey among the wolves. Someday, I will feed a snake. Drink her venom, stay awake. With time all pain will fade. Through your memory I will wade. Barely cold in her grave. Barely warm in my bed. Settling for a draw tonight. Puppet girl, your strings are mine. This one is for you for you. Only for you. Just give in to it never think again. I feel for you."
for the heart i once had,"Heaven today is but a way. To a place I once called home. Heart of a child, one final sigh. As another love goes cold. Once my heart beat to the rhythm of the falling snow. Blackened below, the river now flows. A stream of molten virgin snow. For the heart I'll never have. For the child forever gone. The music flows, because it longs. For the heart I once had. Living today without a way. To understand the weight of the world. Faded and torn, old and forlorn. My weak and hoping heart. For the child, for the light. For the heart I once had. I'll believe and foresee. Everything I could ever be. For the heart I'll never have. For the child forever gone. The music flows, because it longs. For the heart I once had.

I have lost the path before me. The one behind will lead me. Take me. Cure me. Kill me. Bring me home. Every way. Every day. Just another loop in the hangman`s noose. Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home. Every way, every day. I keep on watching us sleep. Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve. Of you and me. Forgive the adoring beast. Redeem me into childhood. Show me myself without the shell. Like the advent of May. I`ll be there when you say. Time to never hold our love. My fall will be for you. My love will be in you. You were the one to cut me. So I`ll bleed forever"

high hopes (pink floyd cover),"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young. In a world of magnets and miracles. Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had begun. Along the long road ,long down to the causeway. Do they still meet there by the cut. There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. but the highest altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world. ****. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. though down this road we've been so many times. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. The taste was sweeter. The nights of wonder. With friends surrounded. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. Forever and ever"

But no Christ to end this war. To deliver my soul from the sword. Hope has shown me a scenery. Paradise poetry. With first snow I`ll be gone. The hopes were high. The choirs were vast. Now my dreams are left to live through you. Red Sun rising. Drown without inhaling. Within, the dark holds hard. Red Sun rising. Curtain falling. Higher than hope my cure lies. Your death saved me.

i want my tears back,"The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey. Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat. A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love. Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly’s wings. Where is the wonder where’s the awe. Where’s dear Alice knocking on the door. Where’s the trapdoor that takes me there. Where’s the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare. Where is the wonder where’s the awe. Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for. Before the years take me. I wish to see. The lost in me. I want my tears back. I want my tears back now. A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone. A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa"

Drown into eyes they’re still blind. Love while the night still hides the withering dawn. First day of love never comes back. A passionate hour`s never a wasted one. The violin, the poet’s hand. Every thawing heart plays your theme with care. Kiss while your lips are still red. While he’s still silent. Rest while bosom is still untouched,. Unveiled hold another hand. While the hand’s still without a tool. Drown into eyes they’re still blind. Love while the night still hides the withering dawn (2x)"
know why the nightingale sings?,What does the free fall feel like?. Asks the boy with a spark in his eye. Know why the nightingale sings. Is the answer to everything. Taking a step to the world unbound. Spinning my fantasies all around. Freed from the gravital leash. I swear the heaven's in my reach. Dancing with the spirit of the air. In this ocean so open and fair. Making love to the gods above. On my maiden voyage so bold. Landing safely to the blue lagoon. Don't know if this is the earth or the moon. Joy of living is no more a mask. The Eden I found will forever last. Migrating with the geese. My soul has finally found peace. Doesn't matter that man has no wings. As long as I hear the nightingale sing...

last ride of the day,"We live in every moment but this one. Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so. What's God if not the spark that started life. Smile of a stranger. Sweet music, starry skies. Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes. Early wake-ups in a moving home. Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun. Open theme park gates waiting for. Riding the day, every day into sunset. Finding the way back home. Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life. The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high. It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead. This moment the dawn of humanity. The last ride of the day. Wake up, Dead Boy. Enter adventureland. Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real. Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail. Magic of a moment. Abracadabra. ( repeat br. + ch. )"

How could I approach her with my outlook so poor. Her beauty being much more than I could endure. So I asked if I could sing a chanson. With a language of ancient and of lore. Gathered the men around us me and the girl in rags. Soon were the melodies heard by everyone. Hear us sing. Watch us dance. Sing with us this tale. With a clap of hands.

Sing with us the tales. Which the music will keep alive"

reach(amaranth demo version),"Baptised with a perfect name. The doubting one by heart. Alone without himself. War between him and the day. Need someone to blame. In the end, little he can do alone. You believe but what you see. You receive but what you give. Reach. For hand-held heart through life. For the dancer to arrive. Reach. And catch me before I fall. Apart from the wandering pack. In this brief flight of time we reach. For the ones, whoever dare. You believe but what you see. You receive but what you give. Reach. For hand-held heart through life. For the dancer to arrive. Reach. And catch me before I fall. Reach. For a friend whoever cares. For someone whoever dares. Reach. To catch me when I fall. Reaching for the doubting one by heart. Hearing voices of the. Catch the one who's falling"
rest calm,I went to die in a seaside hotel. Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments. Deathbed memories of home. Never let me go. Every little memory resting calm in me. Resting in a dream. Smiling back at me. The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home. To caress the river with awe. Within there’s every little memory resting calm with me. Resting in a dream. Smiling back at me. The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home. Rest calm and remember me. You are the moon pulling my black waters. You are the land in my dark closet. Stay by my side until it goes dark forever. When silent the silence comes closer
romanticide,"Godlove and rest my soul. With this sundown neverending. The feel is gone yet you ain't gonna see me fail. I am the decadence of your world. I am an eider covered in oil. Happy hunting, you double-faced carnivore. Tell me why. No heart to cry. Hang me high. The music is dead, the amen is said. The kiss of faith is what I beg. A loving heart `n soul for sale. Tell me why.... Leave me be. And cease to tell me how to feel. To grieve, to shield myself from evil. Leave me be. Od of lies is killing me. Romanticide. Till love do me part. See me ruined by my own creations. Leave me be.... Dead Boy`s alive but without sense. I need a near-death experience. Heart once bold. Now turned to stone. Perfection my messenger from hell. Wine turns to water. Campfires freeze, loveletters burn. Romance is lost. Lord, let me be wrong in this pain. Temporary pain, eternal shame. To take part in this devil`s chess game. Spit on me, let go, get rid of me. And try to survive your stupidity. Enviado por - Danielle"
sacrament of wilderness,Naked in midwinter magic. Lies an angel in the snow. The frozen figure crossed by tracks of wolves. An encounter symbolic yet truthful. With a hungry choir of wolves. An agreement immemorial to be born. Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest. Accompany all charming tunes. Of a sacrament by a campfire. A promise between the tameless. And the one with a tool. Tonight the journey from a cave begins. I want to hunt with the tameless heart. I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar. We will honor the angel in the snow. We will make the streams for our children flow. Wrapped in furs beneath the northern lights. From my cave I watch the land untamed. And wonder if some becoming season. Will make the angel melt in shame. I want to hunt with the tameless heart...
sagan,"Make me wonder. Make me understand. Spark the light of doubt and a newborn mind. Bring the vast unthinkable down to Earth. Always wary of a captive thought. Beware the very first unkind word. See who you are, where from, what of. Entering the unknown. Sending all the poets to the stars. Daring to see beyond the manmade. Woe to you who evade the horizon. Listening to sagan. Dreaming Carl Sagan. Unseen streams. With understanding no poet is trapped. Woe to all who stop at the horizon. What kind of word would we call home. Our own. Oasis of love, humility and hope. Eradicating all that's not for life. What kind of aim would we call high. What kind of life would bathe brightest white. A limitless world will rise. Son of man, dare to let go of the cowardice. [Chorus] x3. Entering the unknown. Sending all the poets to the stars. Daring to see beyond the manmade. Woe to you who evade the horizon. Listening to sagan. Dreaming Carl Sagan. Unseen streams. With understanding no poet is trapped. Woe to all who stop at the horizon"
sahara,"A ballad of dark queen echoes through night. As he flees the curse of gods, the pharaoh's wrath. 1001 nights unseen. The philosopher and the queen. Ancient mariner in a sea of sand. The burning beauty his tomb to die for. 1001 nights unseen. The philosopher and the queen. Horizon's swarming with death. Run!. Heaven has a darkened face. Dunes are soaring, as on a chase. Caravan of the cursed. Chasing him across the waves. May he now rest under aegis of mirage. As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields. 1001 nights unseen. The philosopher and the queen. .

scaretale,"Once upon a time in a daymare. Dying to meet you, little child, enter enter this slideshow. Time for bed the cradle still rocks. 13 chimes on a dead man’s clock. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you. Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear. Burning farms and squaling pigs. A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison. Bite me bite me. Ladies and gentlemen. Be heartlessly welcome!. To Cirque De Morgue. And what a show we have for you tonight!. Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes. Mindless ghouls with lot of limbs to lose. Illusionist, contortionist,. Tightrope-walkers tightening the noose. Horde of spiders, closet tentacles. Laughing harpies with their talons ripping,. Sher-chrisss, per-vizzz. The pendulum still sways for you. Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner,. Fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders"
she is my sin,"Take heed, dear heart. Once apart, she can touch nor me nor you. Dressed as one. A wolf will betray a lamb. Lead astray the gazers. The razors on your seducing skin. In the meadow of sinful thoughts. Every flower`s perfect. To paradise with pleasure haunted, haunted by fear. A sin for him. Desire within, desire within. A burning veil. For the bride too dear for him. A sin for him. Desire within, desire within. Fall in love with your deep dark skin. I am the Fallen. You are what my sins enclose. Lust is not as creative. As its discovery. To paradise with pleasure haunted, haunted by fear. A sin for him.... Bless me, undress me. Pick your prey in a wicked way. God I must confess.... ...I do envy the sinners"
shudder before the beautiful,"The deepest solace lies in understanding,. This ancient unseen stream,. A shudder before the beautiful. Awake, oceanborn. Behold this force. Bring the outside in. Explode the self to epiphany. The very core of life. The soaring high of truth and light. The music of this awe. Deep silence between the notes. Deafens me with endless love. This vagrant Island Earth. A pilgrim shining bright. We are shuddering before the beautiful. Before the plentiful. We, the voyagers. Tales from the seas. Cathedral of green. The unknown, the grand show, the choir of the stars. Interstellar theatre play, the nebulae curtain falls. Imagination, evolution, a species from the vale. Walks in wonder in search of the source of the tale"
slaying the dreamer,"I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice. I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow, sorrow and greed. You bathed in my wine. Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme. Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds. Put a stake through my heart!. And drag me into sunlight. So awake for your greed. As you're slaying the dreamer. Swansong for the Wish of Night. God it hurts, give a name to the pain. Our primrose path to hell is growing weed. Put a stake through my heart!. And drag me into sunlight. So awake for your greed. As you're slaying the dreamer. Blame me, it's me. Coward, a good-for-nothing scapegoat. Dumb kid, living a dream. Romantic only on paper. Tell me why you took all that was mine!. Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray!. Wake up, mow the weed. You'd be nothing without me. Take my life if you have the heart to die. You bastards tainted my soul. Raped my words, played me a fool. Gather your precious glitter and leave me be. The Great Ones are all dead. And I'm tired, too. I truly hate you all!"
sleeping sun,The sun is sleeping quietly. Once upon a century. Wistful oceans calm and red. Ardent caresses laid to rest. For my dreams I hold my life. For wishes I behold my night. The truth at the end of time. Losing faith makes a crime. I wish for this night-time. to last for a lifetime. the darkness around me. Shores of a solar sea. Oh how I wish to go down with the sun. Sleeping. Weeping. With you. Sorrow has a human heart. From my god it will depart. I'd sail before a thousand moons. Never finding where to go. Two hundred twenty-two days of light. Will be desired by a night. A moment for the poet's play. Until there's nothing left to say. I wish for this night-time.... I wish for this night-time.... nähräven
sleepwalker,"Close your eyes. Feel the ocean where passion lies. Silently the senses. Abandon all defences. A place between sleep and awake. End of innocence, unending masquerade. That's where I'll wait for you. Hold me near you. So close I sear you. Seeing, believing. Dreaming, deceiving. A place between sleep and awake. End of innocence, unending masquerade. That's where I'll wait for you. Sleepwalker seducing me. I dare to enter your ecstasy. Lay yourself now down to sleep. In my dreams you're mine to keep. (Sleepwalk with me...) 2X. Sleepwalker seducing me. I dare to enter your ecstasy. Lay yourself now down to sleep. In my dreams you're mine to keep."
"slow, love, slow","Come and share this painting with me. Unveiling of me, the magician that never failed. This deep sigh coiled around my chest. Intoxicated by a major chord. I wonder. Do I love you, or the thought of you?. Slow, love, slow. Only the weak are not lonely. Southern blue, mornign dew. Let-down-your-guards, I-love-you’s. Ice-cream castles, lips to ear rhymes. A slumber deeper than time. Slow, love, slow. Only the weak are not lonely"
song of myself,"1. From A Dusty Bookshelf. 2. All That Great Heart Lying Still. The nightingale is still locked in the cage. The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs. An old oak sheltering me from the blue. Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves. A catnap in the ghost town of my heart. She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts. Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the Ride. Raving harlequins, gigantic toys. A song of me a song in need. Of a courageous symphony. A verse of me a verse in need. Of a pure-heart singing me to peace. All that great heart lying still and slowly dying. All that great heart lying still on an angelwing. All that great heart lying still. In silent suffering. Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end. What is left for encore. Is the same old Dead Boy's song. Sung in silence. All that great heart lying still and slowly dying. All that great heart lying still on an angelwing. A midnight flight into Covington Woods. A princess and a panther by my side. These are Territories I live for. I?d still give my everything to love you more. . A silent symphony. A hollow opus #1,2,3. Sometimes the sky is piano black. Piano black over cleansing waters. Resting pipes, verse of bore. Rusting keys without a door. Sometimes the within is piano black. Piano black over cleansing waters. All that great heart lying still and slowly dying. All that great heart lying still on an angelwing"
stargazers,A grand oasis in the vastness of gloom. Child of dew-spangled cobweb Mother to the moon. Constellations beholders of the 3rd vagrant. Theater for the play of life. Tragedienne of heavens. Watching the eyes of the night. Sailing the virgin oceans. A planetride for the Mother and Child. Floating upon the quiet hydrogen lakes. In this ambrosial merry-go-round they will gaze. Ephemereal life touched by a billion-year show. Separating the poet from the woe. Tragedienne of heavens.... Oracle of the Delphian Domine. Witness of Adam's frailty. Seer of the master prophecy. The stellar world her betrothed. Wanderers in cosmic caravan. Universal bond - The Starborn. A son in the search for the truth. Following the pages of Almagest. Discovering the origin of dreams. Stargazers ride through the ancient realms. Tragedienne of heavens....
storytime,"'Twas the night before. When all through the world. No words, no dreams, then one day. A writer by a fire. Imagined all Gaia. Took a journey into. A child-man's heart. A painter on the shore. Imagined all the world. Within a snowflake on his palm. Unframed by poetry. A canvas of awe. Planet Earth falling back into the stars. I am the voice of Never-Never-Land. The innocence, the dreams of every man. I am the empty crib of Peter Pan. A silent kite against the blue, blue sky. Every chimney, every moonlit sight. I am the story that will read you real. Every memory that you hold dear. I am the journey. I am the destination. I am the home. The tale that reads you. A way to taste the night. The elusive high. Follow the madness. Alice, you know once did. Imaginarium. A dream emporium. Caress the tales. And they will dream you real. A storyteller's game. Lips that intoxicate. The core of all life is a limitless chest of tales. I am the voice of Never-Never-Land. The innocence, the dreams of every man. I am the empty crib of Peter Pan. A silent kite against the blue, blue sky. Every chimney, every moonlit sight. I am the story that will read you real. Every memory that you hold dear. I am the voice of Never-Never-Land. The innocence, the dreams of every man. Searching heavens for another Earth. I am the voice of Never-Never-Land. The innocence, the dreams of every man. I am the empty crib of Peter Pan. A silent kite against the blue, blue sky. Every chimney, every moonlit sight. I am the story that will read you real. Every memory that you hold dear"
swanheart,All those beautiful people. I want to have them all. All those porcelain models. If only I could make them fall. Be my heart a well of love. Flowing free so far above. A wintry eve. Once upon a tale. An Ugly Duckling. Lost in a verse. Of a sparrows carol. Dreaming the stars. Solo. Be my heart a well of love. Flowing free so far above. In my world. Love is for poets. Never the famous balcony scene. Just a dying faith. On the heaven's gate. Solo. Crystal pond awaits the lorn. Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born
the carpenter,Who are you? Man condemned to shine a salvation. Throughout the centuries. Why? Was the wine of the grail. Too sour for man to drink. The carpenter. Carved his anchor. On the dying souls of mankind. On the tomb of this unknown soldier. Lay the tools of the one who for us had died. Tools of the carpenter. The one they lick. The same old sick. Dream of their precious saviour. Kiss them deep. And make them weep. Over promises of eternal peace. The carpenter.... I hear you. Through the symphonic voices of nature. The purity I could never doubt. They tell me to lie on the grass. And observe my saviour. The one crucified to the chirping of birds. The carpenter....
"the crow, the owl and the dove","Don't give me love, don't give me faith. Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead. A crow flew to me, kept its distance. Such a proud creation. I saw its soul, envied its pride. But needed nothing it had. An owl came to me, old and wise. Pierced right through my youth. I learned its ways, envied its sense. But needed nothing it had. Don't give me love, don't give me faith. Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead. A dove came to me, had no fear. It rested on my arm. I touched its paws, envied its love. But needed nothing it had. A swan of mine, she came to me. The lake mirrored her beauty sweet. I kissed her neck, adored her grace. But needed nothing she could give. Gar tuht river, ger te rheged. Gar tuht river, ger te rheged. Gar tuht river, ger te rheged. Don't give me love, don't give me faith. Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead"
the forever moments,"The ticktock of time allows me to see. An authent to an echo. The butterfly to a cocoon. A swan to Ugly Duckling, ruling to an ocean. . The dead times awake. As I've been call myself to yesterday. A flower has fallen its petals. Out of the petals a cradle I will. . My cradle rocks with the waves of time. The time of beauty will never be the same. Oh, little girl, as thou must no leave. Please take me, take me with thee. . Now I hear my mother from the deep. Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep. Wilt blow wee plant that last to recall. As in silence we sing to reborn. ==========================. *Para mais letras, acesse: confinsdanoite.cjb.net"

the heart asks pleasure first,"Silent night surrounding me. On the shore of wistful sea. A kindest heart made me believe. The world as I wish it to be. Wind in the wheat. Kiss by a hearth. Little hideaways for a lonely heart. Cast away in beauty?s gloom. The good in me the child within. A cruelest heart made me forget. The world as I wish it to be. Home inside but lost for life. Human heart longing for love. Slave to the toil this mortal coil. The strife the suffering the void. Wind in the wheat. Kiss by a hearth. A dead calm winter morn. Morning birds and a smile of a stranger. Frozen moments in time. Little hideaways, the marrow of life. Little hideaways for a lonely heart. Wind in the wheat. Kiss by a hearth.

Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard. He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world. Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts. The ones on their travels homeward from afar. This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying. The tears he left behind long ago. The albatross is flying. Making him daydream. The time before he became. One of the world's unseen. Princess in the tower. Children in the fields. Life gave him it all:. An island of the universe. Now his love's a memory. A ghost in the fog. He sets the sails one last time. Saying farewell to the world. Anchor to the water. Seabed far below. Grass still in his feet. And a smile beneath his brow. This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying. The tears he left behind long ago. So long ago (2x). This is for long-forgotten. Light at the end of the world. Horizon crying.

the pharaoh sails to orion,"""Get away from me!. Take heed to thyself and see my face no more!. for in the day Thou see my face. Thou shalt die!"". - Exodus 10:28. A constellation of divine architecture built on Earth. A holy harbour - Orion. Nautical ascension to the firmament. Ship-shaped barrows open my heart to the wisdom of this land. Sailing with the Serpent Chimera of a fiendish sandman. The Unicorn arrives with the westwind to dream My. funeral. ""Thou art born for Horus, for Horus dwells in Thee"". Slumbering with the ebb and the flow of this foaming tomb. ""Thou art born for Seteh, for Seteh dwells in Thee"". Reveal your face to me and guide me through the Stygian fields. Enthral my soul to Sepedet's beams to serve Your will. Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance. Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance. Ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies. apart. An ancient starwalk to merge into the stars. ""Open thy veins for my venom. Kiss the cobras with thy twisted tongue. So shalt thou join the empyrean circus. Where beggars mourn and seraphs dance. In this twilight cathedral. Shall I wed thee,. O Bride of the Netherworld"". Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance. Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance. Ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies. apart.... Join my soul the Hunter in the sky"
the poet and the pendulum,"""WHITE LANDS OF EMPATHICA"". The end. The songwriter's dead. The blade fell upon him. Taking him to the white lands. Of Empathica. Of Innocence. Empathica. Innocence. ""HOME"". The dreamer and the wine. Poet without a rhyme. A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell. One last perfect verse. Is still the same old song. Oh Christ how I hate what I have become. Take me home. Getaway, runaway, fly away. Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. Forgive me. I have but two faces. One for the world. One for God. Save me. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. My home was there 'n then. Those meadows of heaven. Adventure-filled days. One with every smiling face. Please, no more words. Thoughts from a severed head. No more praise. Tell me once my heart goes right. Take me home. Getaway, runaway, fly away. Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. Forgive me. I have but two faces. One for the world. One for God. Save me. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. ""THE PACIFIC"". Sparkle my scenery. With turquoise waterfall. With beauty underneath. The Ever Free. Tuck me in beneath the blue. Beneath the pain, beneath the rain. Goodnight kiss for a child in time. Swaying blade my lullaby. On the shore we sat and hoped. Under the same pale moon. Whose guiding light chose you. Chose you all. ""I'm afraid. I'm so afraid. Being raped again, and again, and again. I know I will die alone. But loved. You live long enough to hear the sound of guns. long enough to find yourself screaming every night. long enough to see your friends betray you. For years I've been strapped unto this altar. Now I only have 3 minutes and counting. I just wish the tide would catch me first. and give me a death I always longed for "". ""DARK PASSION PLAY"". 2nd robber to the right of Christ. Cut in half - infanticide. The world will rejoice today. As the crows feast on the rotting poet. Everyone must bury their own. No pack to bury the heart of stone. Now he's home in hell, serves him well. Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell. The morning dawned, upon his altar. Remains of the dark passion play. Performed by his friends without shame. Spitting on his grave as they came. Getaway, runaway, fly away. Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. Forgive me. I have but two faces. One for the world. One for God. Save me. I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more. I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world. ""Today, in the year of our Lord 2005. Tuomas was called from the cares of the world. He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day. The music he wrote had too long been without silence. He was found naked and dead. With a smile in his face, a pen. and 1000 pages of erased text. "". Save me. ""MOTHER & FATHER"". Be still, my son. You're home. Oh when did you become so cold?. The blade will keep on descending. All you need is to feel my love. Search for beauty, find your shore. Try to save them all, bleed no more. You have such oceans within. In the end. I will always love you. The beginning"

Finding my home from an ocean shore. Wayfarer, heartlander. What if I only had. One more night to live. Home is where the way is. My road goes on forever. One more voyage to go. Dead to the world. Alive for the journey."

tutankhamen,As the sun sets beyond the pyramid. To greet me with its rays. I place my hand on my forehead. To see your chariots' flames. Watch me kneel before you. Hear the cats meowing in the temple. They yearn for the milk you cascaded. As I yearn your promised treasure. Treasure of. Tutankhamen. I am the one it is. Take me with you. Through the stargate. To the valley of the kings. Sacrifice me. Tutankhamen. And let me be your queen. Take me. Tonight and always. We'll breed to fill all earth. Three milleniums it took me to guard your rest.

Two souls with everything yet to be said"

walking in the air,We're walking in the air. We're floating in the moonlit sky. The people far below are sleeping as we fly. I'm holding very tight. I'm riding in the midnight blue. I'm finding I can fly so high above with you. Far across the world. The villages go by like trees. The rivers and the hills. The forests and the streams. Children gaze open mouth. Taken by surprise. Nobody down below believes their eyes. We're surffing in the air. We're swimming in the frozen sky. We're drifting over icy. Mountain floating by. Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep. Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep. We're walking in the air. We're floating in the midnight sky. And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly. I'm holding very tight. I'm riding in the midnight blue. I'm finding I can fly so high above with you

See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder"
weak fantasy,"These stories given to us all. Are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust. Dissonant choirs and downcast eyes. Selfhood of a condescending ape. Behold the crown of a heavenly spy. Forged in blood of those who defy. Kiss the ring, praise and sing. He loves you dwelling in fear and sin. Fear is a choice you embrace. Your only truth. Tribal poetry. Witchcraft filling your void. Lust for fantasy. Male necrocracy. Every child worthy of a better tale. Pick your author from à la carte fantasy. Filled with suffering and slavery. You live only for the days to come. Shoveling trash of the upper caste. Smiling mouth in a rotting head. Sucking dry the teat of the scared. A storytelling breed we are. A starving crew with show-off toys. Fear is a choice you embrace. From words into war of the worlds. This one we forsake with scorn. From lies the strength of our love. Mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn. Wake up child, I have a story to tell. Once upon a time"
where were you last night,"Still. Spinning round in my head. How I regret everything that I said. Why did I tell you to go?. Saving my pride but losing my soul. I'm here all alone. Still wait by the phone. The hours go by. What else could I do but to cry?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. I beg and I cry. I keep asking why. Where were you last night?. Where were you last night?. Lost. In the dark and my fears. If only you saw the tracks of my tears. I think I'm losing my mind. Where did you go and what did you find?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. I beg and I cry. I keep asking why. Where were you last night?. Where were you last night?. ""Essa canção não é do Nightwish. Ela é Ankie Bagger, mas foi originalmente gravada por Nightwish em 2004 no single Wish I Had An Angel"""
