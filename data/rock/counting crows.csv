mr. jones,"Sha la la la la la la..... hmm, uh huh.... I was down at the New Amsterdam. Staring at this yellow-haired girl. Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation. With a black-haired, flamenco dancer. She dances while his father plays, guitar. She's suddenly beautiful. We all want something beautiful. Man I wish I was beautiful. So come dance this silence down through the mornin'. Sha la la la la la la la yeah.. uh huh, yeah.... Cut up, Maria!. Show me some of that Spanish dancin'. Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones. Believe in me. Help me believe in anything. 'Cause I, wanna be someone who believes. Yeah.... Mr. Jones and me, tell each other fairy tales. And we stare at the beautiful women. ""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."". Smiling in the bright lights. Coming through in stereo. When everybody loves you. You can never be lonely. Well, I'm gonna paint my picture. Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray. All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful. Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color. I felt so symbolic yesterday. If I knew Picasso. I would buy myself a gray guitar and play. Mr. Jones and me, look into the future. Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women. ""She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me."". Standing in the spotlight. I bought myself a gray guitar. When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely. I will never be lonely. Said I'm never gonna be, lonely. I want to be a lion. E-Everybody wants to pass as cats. We all want to be big big stars, yeah. But we got different reasons for that. Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything. and I, I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe, yeah. Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio. Yeah we stare at the beautiful women. ""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me."". I want to be Bob Dylan. Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky. When everybody loves you, oh, son, that's just about as funky as you can be. Mr. Jones and me staring at the video. When I look at the television. I want to see me staring right back at me. We all wanna be big stars. But we don't know why and we don't know how. But when everybody loves me. I'm wanna be just about as happy as I could be. Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars."

round here,"Step out the front door like a ghost. Into the fog where no one notices. The contrast of white on white.. And in between the moon and you. Angels get a better view. Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.. I walk in the air between the rain,. Through myself and back again.. Where? I don't know. Maria says she's dying.. Through the door, I hear her crying. Why? I don't know. Round here we always stand up straight. Round here something radiates. Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand. She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis. She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land. Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus. She parks her car outside of my house and. Takes her clothes off,. Says she's close to understanding Jesus. She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood. She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous. Round here we're carving out our names. Round here we all look the same. Round here we talk just like lions. But we sacrifice like lambs. Round here she's slipping though my hands. Oh, Sleeping children better run like the wind. Out of the lightning dream. Mama's little baby better get herself in. Out of the lightning. She says, ""It's only in my head."". She says, ""Shhh...I know it's only in my head."". But the girl on the car in the parking lot. Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot. Can't you see my walls are crumbling?"". Then she looks up at the building. And says she's thinking of jumping.. She says she's tired of life;. She must be tired of something.. Round here she's always on my mind. Round here, Hey man, I got lots of time. Round here we're never sent to bed early. And nobody makes us wait. Round here we stay up very very very very late. I... I can't see nothing, nothing. Round here. (Ya) Catch me if I'm falling. (Ya) Catch me if I'm falling. (Will'ya) Catch me if I'm falling down on you. I said I'm under the gun. Round here.

a long december,"A long December and there`s reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can`t remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin`. Now the days go by so fast. And it`s one more day up in the canyons. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would. The smell of hospitals in winter. And the feeling that it`s all a lot of oysters, but no pearls. All at once you look across a crowded room. To see the way that light attaches to a girl. And it`s one more day up in the canyons. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. If you think you might come to California...I think you should. Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.. And talked a little while about the year. I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,. Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her. And it`s been a long December and there`s reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can`t remember all the times I tried to tell myself. To hold on to these moments as they pass. And it`s one more day up in the canyon. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. It`s been so long since I`ve seen the ocean...I guess I should"
possibility days,"It was a cold three am at JFK. Guess you stayed cause you wanted to stay. We went from zero to everything. All in a day. and then Kennedy took you away. I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm. and the moments that make up. your life till you wake up. You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl and. she tells you she wanted to kiss you. and you know?. The worst part of a good day. is hearing yourself say goodbye. to one more possibility day. that goes on. and on. I go west but your weather has changed. You? re just scared, I mistake it for strange. When you want me to leave. then you start to believe I should stay. I gotta get out of L. A. Seems like the short days are over. cause you just don? t sleep in the daylight. so I don? t sit up nights. I lie on my back on the top of a hill. and your body is breaking. the sky is just shaking. And the worst part of a good day. is knowing. it? s slipping away. that one more possibility day?. it is gone?. We were waiting for winter this year. but you came and it never appeared. Me and you we know too many reasons. for people and seasons. that pass like they weren? t even here. and now living in smiles is better, you say. we carry the burdens of all of our days. So I? m scared that you? ll leave. And you? re scared that I? ll stay. it? s an impossibility day. And we only saw half the ballet. I said goodnight. Goodbye. It seemed like a good thing. So you know it? s a good lie. You can run out of choices. and still hear a voice in your head. when you? re lying in bed. And it says that the best part. of a bad day. is knowing it? s ok. the color of everything changes. the sky rearranges it? s shade. and your smile doesn? t fade. into a phone call. and one bad decision we made. And the worst part of a good day. is the one thing you don? t say. and you don? t know how. but you wish there was some way. So you pull down the shades. and you shut out the light. because somehow we mixed up goodbye and goodnight. And the one thing you won? t say. is everyone knows possibility days. ? are impossible. It just feels wrong. So wrong. still you? re gone, long gone"
perfect blue buildings,"Just down the street from your hotel, baby. I stay at home with my disease. And ain't this position familiar, darling. Well, all monkeys do what they see. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Down on Virginia and La Loma. Where I got friends who'll care for me. You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted. I got an attitude of need. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion. Try to keep myself away from me. It's 4:30 A.M. on a Tuesday. It doesn't get much worse than this. In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle. of these lives which are completely meaningless. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion. Try to keep myself away from myself and me. I got bones beneath my skin, and mister.... There's a skeleton in every man's house. Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody. There's a dead man trying to get out. Please help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion baby. Try to keep myself away from me."
anna begins,"My friend assures me, ""it's all or nothing."". I am not worried. I am not overly concerned. My friend implores me, ""For one time only, make an exception."". I am not worried. Wrap her up in a package of lies. Send her off to a coconut island. I am not worried. I am not overly concerned. With the status of my emotions. ""Oh"" she says ""You're changing"". But we're always changing. It does not bother me to say this isn't love. Because if you don't want to talk about it. Then it isn't love. And I guess I'm going to have to live with that. But I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey. Something in between. And I can always change my name if that's what you mean. My friend assures me ""It's all or nothing."". But I am not really worried. I am not overly concerned. You try to tell yourself. The things you try to tell yourself. To make yourself forget. I am not worried. ""If it's love,"" she said ""then we're going to have to think about the consequences"". She can't stop shaking. I can't stop touching her and.... This time when kindness falls like rain. It washes her away and. Anna begins to change her mind. ""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days"" she says. And I'm not ready for this sort of thing. But I'm not going to break. And I'm not going to worry about it anymore. I'm not going to bend. And I'm not going to break and. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. It seems like I should say ""As long as this is love..."". But it's not all that easy so maybe I should. Snap her up in a butterfly net. Pin her down on a photograph album. I am not worried. I've done this sort of thing before. But then I start to think about the consequences. Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and.... The time when kindness falls like rain. It washes me away and. Anna begins to change my mind. And everytime she sneezes I beleive it's love and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing. She's talking in her sleep. It's keeping me awake. And Anna begins to toss and turn. And every word is nonsense but I understand and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing. Her kindness bangs a gong, it's moving me along. And Anna begins to fade away. It's chasing me away she disappears and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing."
you can't count on me,"Anything's. Hard to change. But hey. I got you down. On your knees again. You watch the sky. It's a pale parade. Of passing clouds. That cover. The bed upon. Which we laid. In the dark. And the memories. That I made. Of a laughing girl. But you're just my toy. And I can't stop. Playing with you, baby. Chorus:. If you think. You need to go. If you wanted. To be free. There's one thing. You need to know. And that's that. You can't count on me. Coming along real good. But I still. Can't do most. Of the things I should. I watch the sky. Coming down to bury me. And I can't stop. This crawling. Out of my skin. I know that you see. Yourself flying in. Out of the sky. Coming down. To carry me. But. I won't come out. So. (Chorus). I watched all. Of the same parades. As they passed on the days. That you wish you'd stayed. All this pain gets me high. And I get off. And you know why. So. (Chorus 2x). Aw, you can't count on me. No, you can't count on me"

All the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Einstein's down on the beach staring into the sand. Cause everything he believes in is shattered. What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway-ay. We all get burned as:. One more sun comes sliding down the sky. One more shadow leans against the wall, and. The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. And all the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Albert's waiting in the sun. On a field American. For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run. One more sun comes sliding down the sky. One more shadow leans against the wall, and. The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. And all the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Albert's fallen on the sun. Cracked his head wide open. The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. And all the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen, fallen. The world begins to disappear.

No no never never never again, uh huh. What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway."
time and time again,"I wanted so badly. Somebody other than me. Staring back at me. But you were gone. I wanted to see you walking backwards. And get the sensation of you coming home. I wanted to see you walking away from me. Without the sensation of you leaving me alone. Time and time again. Time and time again. Time and time again. I can't please myself. I wanted the ocean to cover over me. I wanna sink slowly without getting wet. Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely. I'll walk on water every chance I get. Time and time again. Time and time again. Time and time again. I can't please myself. So when are you coming home. Sweet Angel?. You leaving me alone?. All alone?. Well, if I'm drowning darling. You'll come down this way on your own.

palisades park,"Somebody screamed. All of Jim Jeffries' dreams. Explode into a black fist. He falls to the floor. He stares up at the sky. And he may wish he knew why. But you can't go back there no more. The future sounds so crazy. We all heard that song before. Tomorrow's the name. we changed from yesterday to blame. When the train just don't stop here any more. I got starry-eyed. On the coaster ride. Andy said, ""Man, I need a break from the world outside"". These days my life just careens. Through a pinball machine. I could do so much better. But I can't get off the tilt. And there's a photograph on the TV, black and white. Andy says something to you. Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like. Sheesh, I forget myself sometimes, too. But out past the doorways. Where we are sleeping. Well, the white queen's creeping. The tom cat's peeping. Now I'm not breaking. The train's just shaking. I never made it here before. And there's a wild mouse spinning the girls around. Til they can't take it any more. I used to dream in the dark, in Palisades Park. Up over the cliffs and down among the spark. It's a long life. Full of long nights. But it's not what I was waiting for. Everybody's seen the horses diving down the shore. It's a miracle they don't make them any more. So. Make up ladies. Wake up baby. You walked into the bar like some Saturday star. Stud-straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves. And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde. Gin-tight and aging, but well preserved. Remember Andy outside your bedroom window. Saying, ""Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades. Keep going til we hit Reno, Nevada"". I don't see Andy all that much these days. Still there are pages in back of the action stacks. Where the white queen's creeping. The tom cat's peeping. The train's not breaking. The track's just shaking. I never made it here before. And there's a sky rocket turning the world around. Til I can't take it any more. And you carry that spark from Palisades Park. Down over the cliffs and out into the dark. It's a long life. Full of long nights. But it's not what I was looking for. Everybody dreams of horses flying 'round the shore. It's a bad dream we're not having any more. Man. Have you seen Andy?. Hey man, hey man. Seen him around. Hey man, have you seen my Andy?. Hey man, have you seen him have you seen her. have you seen him have you seen her. Hey, have you seen Andy around?. Dressed up in a pirate vest. All leathers and feathers and pearls. Andy said, ""Look at me, man! I'm cooking. These hands could finger up this whole world"". He said, ""Come outside. Climb out your bedroom window. Shimmy down the fire escape. And say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". Andy says, ""I'm dressed up just like Edie. Changing all the time. My leopard spots to polka dots"". ""... And say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". Well maybe we can move to California. Just meet me at the subway. ""... and say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". The cops all think we're crazy. If you stay, you'll just get married. To a girl who'll never know you. And then say goodbye. Hey man, have you seen Andy?. I lost her in the sun. I was high as a kite. But on lovely in white. Man, you can lose anyone. Hey hey man, have you seen Andy?. I don't know where she's gone. Real love outlives teenage lust. We could get wet and it keeps us warm. Love is like angel dust. Lovely sometimes changes us. Sometimes not. Have you been aching with trust or just. Have you been waking yourself with lust?. Have you been making us up or just. Taking us home?. It's a long wait. At a long light. Cars frozen in flight. All the traffic stops to stare. At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada. Where nothing but air. And a pair of gray paper wings. Andy thinks that I have got nothing to wear. We got nothing new and. We got nothing to wear. We got nothing to wear. We got nothing to wear"
have you seen me lately?,"Get away from me. This isn't gonna be easy. But I don't need you. Believe me. You got a piece of me. But it's just a little piece of me. But I don't need anyone. And these days I feel like I'm fading away. Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio. Have you seen me latley?. I was out on the radio starting to change. Somewhere out in america. It's starting to rain. Could you tell me one thing you remember about me. And have you seen me lately?. I remember me. And all the little things. That make up a memory. Like she said she loved to watch me sleep. Like she said,. ""it's the breathing. It's the breathing in and out and in and..."". Have you seen me latley?. I was out on the radio starting to change. Somewhere out in america. It's starting to rain. Could you tell me the things you remember about me. And have you seen me lately?. I guess I thought that someone would notice. I guess I thought somebody would say something. If I was missing. Can't you see me?. Come on color me in. Come on color me in. Give me your blue rain. Give me your black sky. Give me your green eyes.

rain king,"When I think of heaven. (Deliver me in a black-winged bird). I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers. and all other instruments of faith and sex and God. In the belly of a black-winged bird. Don't try to feed me. I've been here before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been crying , I've been thinking. And I am the Rain King. Mama, why am I so alone?. I can't go outside. I'm scared I might not make it home. I'm alive, but I'm sinking in. If there's anyone at home at your place. Why don't you invite me in. Don't try to bleed me. I've been there before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been lying. I've been sinking. And I am the Rain King. Hey, I only want the same as anyone. Henderson is waiting for the sun. Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends. After all the dreaming I come home again.... When I think of heaven. (Deliver me in a black-winged bird). I think of dying. Lay me down in a field of flame and heather. Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged bird. Don't try to bleed me. I've been here before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been dying. I been drinking and I am the Rain King.."
earthquake driver,"I was born again a little north of Disney Land. Somewhere under Wonderland and Hollywood. But then I had to go skipping and diving and bouncing back to New York City. Straight through the heart of America where all the wild things grow. I want to be an earthquake driver. I want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. I mean, I live alone but I am hungry for affection. I just struggle with connection til the water calls me home. Down into ocean among millions of other lonely people. Drowning among the only people we are ever going to know. I want to be an earthquake driver. I want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. I want to be like the people I see. They run all over just like me. I was saved but what keeps me awake. Is I'm tied into the lightning line. And I wanna be where the sun is shining. All night just a waste of time I, I don't want to see people like me. Just sleeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in. You look at me like I'm some kind of carnival attraction. You say love's this abstraction, just some ghost that you chase. Well, I am sorry friend, I am a blank space. But the words you remember from whenever you saw my face. I want to be an earthquake driver. I don't want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. I want to be like the people I see. Hey man, they run all over just like me. I want to thank for what keeps me awake. This unplugged ears to the lightning lining. I want to see if the sun is shining. All night, chasing time I, I don't want to be with people like me. Just creeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in. So what is the point of this famous self absorption. We turn ourselves into orphans and then spend out nights alone. Living in fear of some kind of imaginary consequence. Terror incognito. I want to be an earthquake driver. I don't want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. Truth is I don't want to be no earthquake driver. And I don't want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. Oh man, just don't want to go home. No, I do not want to go home"
angels of the silence,"Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand. Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand?. I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now. Where'd you come from?. Where am I going?. Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for.... Waiting for you. All my sins.... I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you. All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming. Everynight these silhouettes appear above my head.

Waiting for you. All my sins.... I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you. All my innocense is wasted on the dead and dreaming. I dream of Michaelangelo when I'm lying in my bed. Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book. And suck my blood, break my nerve, offer me their arms. Well, I will not be an enemy of anything. I'll only stand here. Waiting for you. All my sins.... I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you. All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming"

a long december,"A long December and there`s reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can`t remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin`. Now the days go by so fast. And it`s one more day up in the canyons. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would. The smell of hospitals in winter. And the feeling that it`s all a lot of oysters, but no pearls. All at once you look across a crowded room. To see the way that light attaches to a girl. And it`s one more day up in the canyons. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. If you think you might come to California...I think you should. Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.. And talked a little while about the year. I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,. Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her. And it`s been a long December and there`s reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can`t remember all the times I tried to tell myself. To hold on to these moments as they pass. And it`s one more day up in the canyon. And it`s one more night in Hollywood. It`s been so long since I`ve seen the ocean...I guess I should"

all my failures,"Addressing a prayer into the air. And the shadows of lights. So nobody heard love's not for words. In a world at the end of it's night. For everyone that left me. They're so easy to forget. 'Cause I haven't let my failures hit me yet.. Your voice on the phone. The blood from the stone. And tears that I can't understand. As if I could heal the guilt I don't feel. Or by silently giving my hand. Well, I'm sure I'd never loved you. It'd be too fierce and too correct. 'Cause I haven't let my failures hit me yet. May my demon reveal itself tenderly. May he not leave me broken. May he leave me to be. So wherever I'm bound. My ear to the ground and my thoughts on their way back to you. As eternity's slave, you could write that on my grave. When I'm finished resisting it's true. While I'm shaking hands with darkness. It's with the warm wind that I admit. That I haven't let my failures hit me yet"
all my friends,"Thought I might get a rocket ride. When I was a child but it was a lie. That I told myself when I needed something good. At seventeen, had a better dream.. Now I'm thirty-three and it isn't me. But I'd think of something better if I could. All my friends and lovers leave me behind. I'm still looking for a girl. One way or another. I'm just hoping to find a way. To put my feet out in the world. Caught some grief from a falling leaf. As she tumbled down to the dirty ground. Said I should have put her back there if I could. But everyone needs a better day. And I'm trying to find me a better way. To get from the things I do to the things I should. All my friends and lovers leave me alone. To try to have a little fun. One way or another I just wish I had known. To go out walking in the sun. And find out if you were the one. Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?. And did you wanna dance with me?. Did you wanna hum a little harder now?. Can you see her waiting there?. Can you see her? Because I'm almost there. Can you see her waiting there for someone like me?. All you want is a beauty queen. Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine. All you want is a place to lay your head. You go to sleep dreaming how you would. Be a different kind if you thought you could. But you come awake the way you are instead. All my friends and lovers shine like the sun. I just turn and walk away. One way or another. I'm not coming undone. I'm just waiting for the day."

anna begins,"My friend assures me, ""it's all or nothing."". I am not worried. I am not overly concerned. My friend implores me, ""For one time only, make an exception."". I am not worried. Wrap her up in a package of lies. Send her off to a coconut island. I am not worried. I am not overly concerned. With the status of my emotions. ""Oh"" she says ""You're changing"". But we're always changing. It does not bother me to say this isn't love. Because if you don't want to talk about it. Then it isn't love. And I guess I'm going to have to live with that. But I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey. Something in between. And I can always change my name if that's what you mean. My friend assures me ""It's all or nothing."". But I am not really worried. I am not overly concerned. You try to tell yourself. The things you try to tell yourself. To make yourself forget. I am not worried. ""If it's love,"" she said ""then we're going to have to think about the consequences"". She can't stop shaking. I can't stop touching her and.... This time when kindness falls like rain. It washes her away and. Anna begins to change her mind. ""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days"" she says. And I'm not ready for this sort of thing. But I'm not going to break. And I'm not going to worry about it anymore. I'm not going to bend. And I'm not going to break and. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. It seems like I should say ""As long as this is love..."". But it's not all that easy so maybe I should. Snap her up in a butterfly net. Pin her down on a photograph album. I am not worried. I've done this sort of thing before. But then I start to think about the consequences. Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and.... The time when kindness falls like rain. It washes me away and. Anna begins to change my mind. And everytime she sneezes I beleive it's love and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing. She's talking in her sleep. It's keeping me awake. And Anna begins to toss and turn. And every word is nonsense but I understand and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing. Her kindness bangs a gong, it's moving me along. And Anna begins to fade away. It's chasing me away she disappears and. Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing."

In August and everything after. I'm after everything. I said yeah yeah yeah yeah - lalala. Well you got your reservations. And you got your seven-million dollar home. You got the number of some girl in New York City. Who's always wide awake. So you never spend the night alone. You got a nasty little habit. Of peekin down the shirts of all the little girls. As they pass you by. And I wonder when it all catches up to you. And they finally take you down?. Are you gonna cry?. Well I already got my disease. So take your fuckin filthy hands off of me. Yeah well I hope you weren't expecting to be crucified?. The best that they can do. Is to hang you from the nearest tree. It's midnight in San Francisco. And I'm waiting here for Jesus on my knees. And August and everything after. I want somebody else to bleed for me. I said yeah yeah yeah lalala. They came down from North Dakota. With confidence in the military mind. And now everyone I know is turning showgirl. And dancing with their shirt off. In some Las Vegas hotel line. So I'm going down to Los Angeles. To plead for my immediate release. And the lawyer says, yeah we'll let you go. But you gotta give us a better reason. Than ""please, please, please"". But I no longer know how to pray. I live in dog town and it's a Dalmatian parade. And I, I change my spots over and over. But they never seem to fade away. I am the last remaining Indian. Looking for the place where the buffalo roam. In August and everything after. Man them buffalo ain't never comin home. And I said in August and everything after. Man them buffalo ain't never comin home. I said oh yeah yeah yeah lalala"

I want to thank for what keeps me awake. This unplugged ears to the lightning lining. I want to see if the sun is shining. All night, chasing time I, I don't want to be with people like me. Just creeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in. So what is the point of this famous self absorption. We turn ourselves into orphans and then spend out nights alone. Living in fear of some kind of imaginary consequence. Terror incognito. I want to be an earthquake driver. I don't want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. Truth is I don't want to be no earthquake driver. And I don't want to be an aquarium diver. I just don't want to go home. Oh man, just don't want to go home. No, I do not want to go home"
einstein on the beach,"Albert's always sincere, he's a sensitive type. His intentions are clear, he wanna be well-liked. But if everything is nothing, then are we anything?. Is it better to be better than to be anything?. And Albert's vision is blooming uncontrolled. All his wings are slowly sinking. The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. All the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Einstein's down on the beach staring into the sand. Cause everything he believes in is shattered.

The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. And all the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Albert's waiting in the sun. On a field American. For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run. One more sun comes sliding down the sky. One more shadow leans against the wall, and. The world begins to disappear. The worst things come from inside here. And all the king's men reappear. For an eggman, fallen off a wall. Who'll never be together again. Albert's fallen on the sun. Cracked his head wide open.

No no never never never again, uh huh. What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway."
elvis went to hollywood,"November promises it seems. A book in February dreams. That don't come true. Do you remember me?. I don't remember you. are you the one who likes to sing. To some other one. We are driving on the ceiling. There are aliens on motorcycles. Riding on the radio. While they destroy the world. I said, oh, no, no, no. The future is sad. The news is dead.

four days,All I want is something good. It gets harder every time. She is leaving here tonight. Take a breath. Take your time. Spread your wings and rise. Make a mark upon the wall. Paint your face and pass the time. Close your eyes and she ascends. Hold your breath and ease your mind. Forty Thousand times. Time fades into the night. They descend and then they climb. Feathers falling through the night. Have you seen Ohio rise?. It has been four days and nights. All I want is something fine. It gets harder every time. She is sleeping far away. Take a breath. Take your time. Spread your wings and rise. Rise into the black Ohio skies.
four white stallions,"She had four white stallions coming up around the bend. four strong angels at her command to send. four more seasons, for all thats broken to mend. I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again. She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure. carved by an artist who's hand is demure. got a mind like a sabre. razor sharp and sure. God how I hate myself for still wanting her. Tell me its nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure. no way to find theres nothing left to me and her. nothing more but a heart still at war. She had four white stallions coming up around the bend. four strong angels already sent. four more seasons for all thats broken to mend...."
friend of the devil,"I lit out from Reno,. I was trailed by twenty hounds. Didn't get to sleep that night. 'Till the morning came around.. Set out runnin' but I take my time. A friend of the devil is a friend of mine. If I get home before daylight,. I just might get some sleep tonight.. Ran into the devil, babe,. He loaned me twenty bills. I spent the night in Utah. In a cave up in the hills.. Set out runnin' but I take my time,. A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,. If I get home before daylight,. I just might get some sleep tonight.. I ran down to the levee. But the devil caught me there. He took my twenty dollar bill. And vanished in the air.. Set out runnin' but I take my time. A friend of the devil is a friend of mine. If I get home before daylight,. I just might get some sleep tonight.. Got two reasons why I cry. Away each lonely night,. The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,. And she's my hearts delight.. The second one is prison, baby,. The sheriff's on my trail,. And if he catches up with me,. I'll spend my life in jail.. Got a wife in Chino, babe,. And one in Cherokee. The first one says she's got my child,. But it don't look like me.. Set out runnin' but I take my time,. A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,. If I get home before daylight,.

ghost train,"I took the cannonball down to the ocean. Across the desert from sea to shining sea. I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation. Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me. ""How do you do?"". She said, ""Hey, how do you do?"". She buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from. She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow. Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness. Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go. ""How do you do?"". She said, ""How do you do?"". I took the cannonball down to the ocean. Watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves. Love is a ghost train howling on the radio. ""Remember everything."" she said, ""when only memory remains."". ""How do you do?"". She said, ""Hey, how do you do?""."
girl from the north country,"Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,. Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,. Remember me to one who lives there.. She once was a true love of mine.. Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,. When the rivers freeze and summer ends,. Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,. To keep her from the howlin' winds.. Please see for me if her hair hangs long,. If it rolls and flows all down her breast.. Please see for me if her hair hangs long,. That's the way I remember her best.. I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.. Many times I've often prayed. In the darkness of my night,. In the brightness of my day.. So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,. Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,. Remember me to one who lives there.. She once was a true love of mine."
god of ocean tides,"Close the door on a short night. Lift the lid on the daylight. 6: 09 West Tennessee time. And I buy all my days. At the same place where the girl sells her nights. To a God of ocean tides. All night long. Writing poems to California. Melodies of failure. And the people I have thrown away. Meanwhile, somewhere west of Carolina. In a congregation of strangers. We are digging holes to China. Then we pray to our reflections. In the water when it rises. I said headlights pin the highway down. Jesus spins the world around. And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down. Goodbye all my days. I know I said I never loved you. But I might just try again tonight. Truck stops and river Gods. Gas stations of the Cross. Following a ghost. Following a ghost. I pray the water wash away. The memories and the cost. Cary me south, to the sea. Along with your memories of me. We are born in the water. Now we return to Thee. Colored lights. And birthday cakes. Candle wax. On paper plates. Breathe the water. Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye. You can see through water. All the way up to the sky. Gods of water, Gods of rain. Cover up the sun again. We are crossing it at the Mississippi line. And I tried all my days. To love you just the way you hoped I might. But I'm leaving here tonight. I can't remember yesterday. I tried, if I said I could I lied"

goodnight l.a.,"I said goodnight LA. Cause I'm awake in my room. I've been up for 38 hours. And it don't look like sleep's coming soon. Cause I could break like a bird. Or I could swallow the sea. It seems like the daylight is coming. No one is watching but me. But I don't mind the dark. Discovering the day. Cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray. what brings me down now is love. cause I can never get enough. And what brings me down now is love. cause I can never get enough of love. And it's a dangerous time. for a heart on a wire. Shuttle from station to station. noisily not knowing why. So I put my head on the ground. and the sky is a wheel. Spinning these days into things that I've lost. But you can keep all the years. But I don't mind the days. gone rolling away. Cause all this sunlight feels warm on my face today. But what brings me down now is love. cause I can never get enough. What brings me down now is love. cause I can never get enough never get enough. Never get enough no no. Never get enough of love. I can never get enough of love. What brings me, brings me down now is love. Cause I can never get enough of love. I can never get enough of love 2X. I can never ever get enough. I can never get enough of love."

hanging tree,She brings. Her friends. So we won't have. To be alone. A fear. That I might. Loose composer. Without warning. I am a child of fire. I am a liar. I have desire. But I was born inside. The sun this morning. This dirty life of mine. Is hangin' me up. Aall the time. This dirty life. Is just a hanging tree. This dirty life of mine. Is hangin' me up. All the time. This dirty life. Is just a haning tree. They say good evening. When they don't know. What to say. And they say good morning. We wish you would go home. You open windows. And you wait for someone. Warm to come inside. And then you freeze. To death alone. (Chorus). You call the waittress. But it's time for her to go. And shit I know. Everyone eventually leaving. But I got a pair of wings. For my birthday. And I will fall down. Through the sun. This evening. (Chorus)
hard candy,On certain Sundays in November. When the weather bothers me. I empty drawers of other summer's. Where my shadows used to be. She is standing by the water. As her smile begins to curl. In this or any other summer. She is something all together different. Never just an ordinary girl. And in the evenings on Long Island. When the colors start to fade. She wears a silly yellow hat. That someone gave her when she stayed. I didn't think that she returned it. We left New York in a whirl. Time expands and then contracts. When you are spinning. In the grips of someone. Who is not an ordinary girl. When you sleep. You find your mother in the night. But she stays just out of sight. So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming. And when you wake the morning covers you with light. And it makes you feel alright. But it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. You send your lover off to China. Then you wait for her to call. You put your girl up on a pedestal. Then you wait for her to fall. I put my summer's back in a letter. And I hide it from the world. All the regrets you can't forget. Are somehow pressed upon a picture. In the face of such an ordinary girl. When you sleep. You find your mother in the night. But she fades just out of sight. So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming. And when you wake the morning showers you with light. And it makes you feel alright. But it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Again 4X. It's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Again 4X. And it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Go ask her to come around. And see me late after dark. Don't ask me to come around. Then wait to see if there's a spark..

holiday in spain,"Got no place to go. But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico. She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin. And if I bring a little music I could fit right in.

Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree. I may take a holiday in Spain. Leave my wings behind me. Drive this little girl insane. And fly away to someone new. Everybody's gone. They left the television screaming that the radio's on. Someone stole my shoes. But there's a couple of bananas. And a bottle of booze. Oh well, happy new year's baby!. We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day. Or we could simply pack our bags. And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag. I may take a holiday in Spain. Leave my wings behind me. Flush my worries down the drain. And fly away to somewhere new. Take a holiday in Spain. Leave my wings behind me. Drive this little girl insane. Fly away to someone new. Fly away to someone new. Fly away to someone new."

You're a pill to ease the pain. of all the stupid things i do. I'm an anchor on the line. of a clock that tells the time. that is running out on you
insignificant,"Can you see me up on a building. From down on the pavement. Or out in the crowd?. Can you see me. In the glare of the lamp post?. 'Cause I am walking a tightrope. Into the moon. Chorus:. I don't want. Feel so different. But I don't want. To be insignificant. And I don't how to see. The same things different now. Oh, can you see me?. I am one in a million. Yeah, I'm Icarus falling. Out of the sun. She sees me falling. A line of spotlights. And chalk lines. Through night black. As a bedroom. And white as a lie. (Chorus). Diving through the dark. While the night turns blue. And you wear your intentions. As I wear my intentions. So clear. If you see me, wading through water. Or come drowning a river. Right in front of the world. Hey, if you crash ? my anger. 'Cause it's as bright as white paper. But it's as dark as a girl. (Chorus 2x)"
john appleseed's lament,"I stepped out the front door into winter and the world outside. I stepped out the door to new york city, my hair was barely dry. I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside. Nothing happening in the elevator. Nothing happening on the stairs. Nothing ever happening when I am sleeping. I cannot stay there. How'd you find a party when you're in your room. How'd you find the action man, the action is everywhere. And inside to climb outside your bedroom window. Paint a picture on a cloud. Oh if you decide that you can't hide inside your mind. Provide the slide to get you out. Feels just like you're falling and you're going down. But everybody loves you when you hit the ground. I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to pocahontas. I pray to john appleseed. Oh I cigarette the winter air. Then stand my way down seventh street. Some chick yells Jesus love me more than I know. But less than I need. I parade down the valley to the ballerina. Then I step off into the air. Point my sunglasses east towards jerusalem. And then follow all the pharoahs there. They're building pyramids in western square. Driving in circles round the circus til the circles in the air. My love says come on adam tell me. What the hell is wrong with you. She says, come on adam tell me, what the hell. Am I supposed to do?. She says, I could love you, I could leave you. I can't live what you put me through. I call the winter maria cause I do not know her face. I call the endless sky emilia. Because she stays with me from place to place. I call the sun my love emanuel, she cradle me in her embrace. I left, nothing happening in the kitchen. Nothing happening on the floor. Nothing happening in my bed. She don't sleep there no more. Hard to find the bottom when you're in the air"

margery (música inédita),"In the still water she lies down. Shaking through the press of sunlight. We rolled into Lexington. She shakes off the drop of daylight. Water beading up her chest. Bleeding down between her knees. Rivers in Kentucky flow. Between the bluegrass wavy seas. But oh, Margery. Twists the knife once more inside of me. Breathless with anticipation. Baited reelers set their hooks. Tuck their heads beneath the high grass. And lie and wait beside the brooks. Were infants pushing slowly through. Frustration leading back along. The alleys of a childhood. That will not release us willingly. But oh, Margery ... Sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (straight into mebaby). Dust me off and shut me down. And dream of where I haven't been. Close the door inside my heart. Stuck in the south Atlantic wind. I have hollow eyes. Haunting only to myself. Even so, I can't stop calling. These great big hollows in my self. I took the train from California. To the far side of the continent. Woke up in Kentucky. Where a wedding was about to end. I looked up at Anna. She turned back to look at me. It's best to kill the ones that matter. Render blind the ones who see. But oh, Margery. Takes the blade and walks away from me. Oh, Margery. Love like blood is pouring out of me. Oh, Margery. My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby. Oh, I can't shut it in. It's got far too many doors to block the wind. Oh, I can't shut it in. It's got far too many doors to block the wind"

mrs. potter's lullaby,"Well, I woke up in mid-afternoon, 'cause that's when it all hurts the most. I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host. If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts. You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast. Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame. I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame. If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame. And though I'll never forget your face, sometimes I can't remember my name. Hey, Mrs. Potter, don't cry. Hey, Mrs. Potter, I know why, but. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?. Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing. And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings. And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring. And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything. Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said. And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head. And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead. When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in my bed. Hey, Mrs. Potter, don't go. Hey, Mrs. Potter, I don't know, but. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?. All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep. And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep. All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep. Hey, I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep. So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams. It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream. Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem. Aw, but I'd sure like to find out. So why don't you climb down off that movie screen?. Hey, Mrs. Potter, don't turn. Hey, Mrs. Potter, I burn for you. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?. When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor. And orders another. Well, I wonder what he did that for. That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before. So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door. We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars. We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great pioneer town bars. We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars. You can see a million miles tonight. But you can't get very far. Aw, you can see a million miles tonight. But you can't get very far. Hey, Mrs. Potter, I won't touch, and. Hey, Mrs. Potter, it's not much, but. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?. Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me?."

on a tuesday in amsterdam long ago,A picture of Amsterdam. Bare trees under glass. Framed. In the afternoon light. Of a winter long past. When I was a raiser. To Dublin I'd roam. She was a bareback rider. Some miles from home. Come back to me. She's a carnival driver. Hung in the sky. Cutting through time. Like a memory. Strung on a wire. The color of anything. Fades in the air. But she is the film. Of a book of the story. Of the smell of her hair. Come back to me. When every thing's over. And every thing's clear. When everyone's older. And no one is here. I try to remember. A girl on a wire. Tumbling and diving. Above Stephen's Green. Like a kite on the air. Come back to me
on almost any sunday morning,Take a message. To your head. Just stay beside her. In the bed. You were so stupid. To believe in things. You couldn't see. Then make them. All you want. If you haven't. Got the reasons. Just make up. Any reasons. Then pick them. 'Til they're torn. Take it all away. You took your coat today. But they all. Go back in the morning. Make a time. To find your way. I got. A little further today. Wash your eyes. Clear of anything. Make them empty circles. Dress yourself. In black or grey. I'm hungry. Like a wild waif. Or only child. This lithium. Is heroin to me. It makes it all withdraw. All the anger and loss. But it all keeps. Coming back. In the morning. You keep yourself. Too clean. You dig yourself. A dream. That we won't be. Coming home alone. Not this time (4x)
ooh la la,"Poor old granddad,. I laughed at all his words,. I thought he was a bitter man,. He spoke of women's ways.. 'They trap you, then they use you,. before you even know.. Well love is blind, and you're far too kind.. Don't ever let it show.'. CHORUS:. I wish that I knew what I know now,. when I was younger.. I wish that I knew what I know now,. when I was stronger.. The can-can such a pretty show. Will steal your heart away. But backstage back on earth again. The dressing rooms are grey. They come on strong and it ain't too long. For they make you feel a man. But love is blind and you soon will find. You're just a boy again. When you want her lips, you get her cheek. Makes you wonder where you are. If you want some more then she's fast asleep. Leaves you twinkling with the stars. Poor young grandson there's nothing I can say. You'll have to learn, just like me. And that's the hardest way, ooh la la.. CHORUS"

She said ""We're open all night. So won't you come inside. It's gonna be all right"". She said ""tired?"". I said ""I'm a little bit unstable"". She said ""Honey, I will help you if I'm able. There's a bottle of relief upon the table. And we're open all night. So won't you come inside. It's gonna be all right"". She said ""I was born the year the rockets landed. Circa 1969 and I got stranded. Yeah, but the comet's getting close. And I can't stand it."". She said ""We're open all night. So won't you come inside"". Exit A. Small cafe. Smoke at three. Georgia moonlight. It's eight a.m.. I've been drinking all night. And there is nothing I will not do to make it all right. She said ""We're open all night. So won't you come inside. It's gonna be all right"""
palisades park,"Somebody screamed. All of Jim Jeffries' dreams. Explode into a black fist. He falls to the floor. He stares up at the sky. And he may wish he knew why. But you can't go back there no more. The future sounds so crazy. We all heard that song before. Tomorrow's the name. we changed from yesterday to blame. When the train just don't stop here any more. I got starry-eyed. On the coaster ride. Andy said, ""Man, I need a break from the world outside"". These days my life just careens. Through a pinball machine. I could do so much better. But I can't get off the tilt. And there's a photograph on the TV, black and white. Andy says something to you. Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like. Sheesh, I forget myself sometimes, too. But out past the doorways. Where we are sleeping. Well, the white queen's creeping. The tom cat's peeping. Now I'm not breaking. The train's just shaking. I never made it here before. And there's a wild mouse spinning the girls around. Til they can't take it any more. I used to dream in the dark, in Palisades Park. Up over the cliffs and down among the spark. It's a long life. Full of long nights. But it's not what I was waiting for. Everybody's seen the horses diving down the shore. It's a miracle they don't make them any more. So. Make up ladies. Wake up baby. You walked into the bar like some Saturday star. Stud-straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves. And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde. Gin-tight and aging, but well preserved. Remember Andy outside your bedroom window. Saying, ""Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades. Keep going til we hit Reno, Nevada"". I don't see Andy all that much these days. Still there are pages in back of the action stacks. Where the white queen's creeping. The tom cat's peeping. The train's not breaking. The track's just shaking. I never made it here before. And there's a sky rocket turning the world around. Til I can't take it any more. And you carry that spark from Palisades Park. Down over the cliffs and out into the dark. It's a long life. Full of long nights. But it's not what I was looking for. Everybody dreams of horses flying 'round the shore. It's a bad dream we're not having any more. Man. Have you seen Andy?. Hey man, hey man. Seen him around. Hey man, have you seen my Andy?. Hey man, have you seen him have you seen her. have you seen him have you seen her. Hey, have you seen Andy around?. Dressed up in a pirate vest. All leathers and feathers and pearls. Andy said, ""Look at me, man! I'm cooking. These hands could finger up this whole world"". He said, ""Come outside. Climb out your bedroom window. Shimmy down the fire escape. And say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". Andy says, ""I'm dressed up just like Edie. Changing all the time. My leopard spots to polka dots"". ""... And say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". Well maybe we can move to California. Just meet me at the subway. ""... and say goodbye"". ""Come outside... "". The cops all think we're crazy. If you stay, you'll just get married. To a girl who'll never know you. And then say goodbye. Hey man, have you seen Andy?. I lost her in the sun. I was high as a kite. But on lovely in white. Man, you can lose anyone. Hey hey man, have you seen Andy?. I don't know where she's gone. Real love outlives teenage lust. We could get wet and it keeps us warm. Love is like angel dust. Lovely sometimes changes us. Sometimes not. Have you been aching with trust or just. Have you been waking yourself with lust?. Have you been making us up or just. Taking us home?. It's a long wait. At a long light. Cars frozen in flight. All the traffic stops to stare. At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada. Where nothing but air. And a pair of gray paper wings. Andy thinks that I have got nothing to wear. We got nothing new and. We got nothing to wear. We got nothing to wear. We got nothing to wear"
perfect blue buildings,"Just down the street from your hotel, baby. I stay at home with my disease. And ain't this position familiar, darling. Well, all monkeys do what they see. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Down on Virginia and La Loma. Where I got friends who'll care for me. You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted. I got an attitude of need. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion. Try to keep myself away from me. It's 4:30 A.M. on a Tuesday. It doesn't get much worse than this. In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle. of these lives which are completely meaningless. Help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion. Try to keep myself away from myself and me. I got bones beneath my skin, and mister.... There's a skeleton in every man's house. Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody. There's a dead man trying to get out. Please help me stay awake, I'm falling.... Asleep in perfect blue buildings. Beside the green apple sea. Gonna get me a little oblivion baby. Try to keep myself away from me."
possibility days,"It was a cold three am at JFK. Guess you stayed cause you wanted to stay. We went from zero to everything. All in a day. and then Kennedy took you away. I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm. and the moments that make up. your life till you wake up. You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl and. she tells you she wanted to kiss you. and you know?. The worst part of a good day. is hearing yourself say goodbye. to one more possibility day. that goes on. and on. I go west but your weather has changed. You? re just scared, I mistake it for strange. When you want me to leave. then you start to believe I should stay. I gotta get out of L. A. Seems like the short days are over. cause you just don? t sleep in the daylight. so I don? t sit up nights. I lie on my back on the top of a hill. and your body is breaking. the sky is just shaking. And the worst part of a good day. is knowing. it? s slipping away. that one more possibility day?. it is gone?. We were waiting for winter this year. but you came and it never appeared. Me and you we know too many reasons. for people and seasons. that pass like they weren? t even here. and now living in smiles is better, you say. we carry the burdens of all of our days. So I? m scared that you? ll leave. And you? re scared that I? ll stay. it? s an impossibility day. And we only saw half the ballet. I said goodnight. Goodbye. It seemed like a good thing. So you know it? s a good lie. You can run out of choices. and still hear a voice in your head. when you? re lying in bed. And it says that the best part. of a bad day. is knowing it? s ok. the color of everything changes. the sky rearranges it? s shade. and your smile doesn? t fade. into a phone call. and one bad decision we made. And the worst part of a good day. is the one thing you don? t say. and you don? t know how. but you wish there was some way. So you pull down the shades. and you shut out the light. because somehow we mixed up goodbye and goodnight. And the one thing you won? t say. is everyone knows possibility days. ? are impossible. It just feels wrong. So wrong. still you? re gone, long gone"
rain king,"When I think of heaven. (Deliver me in a black-winged bird). I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers. and all other instruments of faith and sex and God. In the belly of a black-winged bird. Don't try to feed me. I've been here before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been crying , I've been thinking. And I am the Rain King. Mama, why am I so alone?. I can't go outside. I'm scared I might not make it home. I'm alive, but I'm sinking in. If there's anyone at home at your place. Why don't you invite me in. Don't try to bleed me. I've been there before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been lying. I've been sinking. And I am the Rain King. Hey, I only want the same as anyone. Henderson is waiting for the sun. Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends. After all the dreaming I come home again.... When I think of heaven. (Deliver me in a black-winged bird). I think of dying. Lay me down in a field of flame and heather. Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged bird. Don't try to bleed me. I've been here before and I deserve a little more. I belong in the service of the Queen. I belong anywhere but in between. She's been dying. I been drinking and I am the Rain King.."
raining in baltimore,"This circus is falling down on its knees. The big top is crumbling down. It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east. Where you should be, no one's around. I need a phone call. I need a raincoat. I need a big love. I need a phone call. These train conversations are passing me by. And I don't have nothing to say. You get what you pay for. But I just had no intention of living this way. I need a phone call. I need a plane ride. I need a sunburn. I need a raincoat. And I get no answers. And I don't get no change. It's raining in Baltimore, baby. But everything else is the same. There's things I remember and things I forget. I miss you. I guess that I should. Three thousand five hundred miles away. But what would you change if you could?. I need a phone call. Maybe I should buy a new car. I can always hear a freight train. If I listen real hard. And I wish it was a small world. Because I'm lonely for the big towns. I'd like to hear a little guitar. I think it's time to put the top down. I need a phone call. I need a raincoat."

return of the grievous angel,"Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich. And welcome me back to town. Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor. And I'll show you how it all went down. Out with the truckers and the kickers. And the cowboy angels. And a good saloon in every single town. Oh, and I remember something you once told me. And I'll be damned if it did not come true. Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down. And they all lead me straight back home to you. `Cause I headed West to grow up with the country. Across those prairies with the waves of grain. And I saw my devil,. and I saw my deep blue sea. And I thought about a calico bonnet from. Cheyenne to Tennessee. We flew straight across that river bridge,. last night a half past two. The switchman wave his lantern goodbye. and so long as we went rolling through. Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel. And now I know just what I have to do. And the man on the radio won't leave me alone. He wants to take my money for something. that I've never been shown. And I saw my devil,. and I saw my deep blue sea. And I thought about a calico bonnet from. Cheyenne to Tennessee. The news I could bring I met up with the king. On his head an amphetamine crown. He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt. And lighted out for some desert town. . Out with the truckers and the kickers. And the cowboy angels. And a good saloon in every single town. Oh, but I remembered something you once told me. And I'll be damned if it did not come true. Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down. And they all lead me straight back home to you. Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down.

round here,"Step out the front door like a ghost. Into the fog where no one notices. The contrast of white on white.. And in between the moon and you. Angels get a better view.

Through the door, I hear her crying. Why? I don't know. Round here we always stand up straight. Round here something radiates. Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand. She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis. She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land. Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus. She parks her car outside of my house and. Takes her clothes off,. Says she's close to understanding Jesus. She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood. She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous. Round here we're carving out our names. Round here we all look the same. Round here we talk just like lions. But we sacrifice like lambs. Round here she's slipping though my hands. Oh, Sleeping children better run like the wind. Out of the lightning dream. Mama's little baby better get herself in. Out of the lightning. She says, ""It's only in my head."". She says, ""Shhh...I know it's only in my head."". But the girl on the car in the parking lot. Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot. Can't you see my walls are crumbling?"". Then she looks up at the building. And says she's thinking of jumping.. She says she's tired of life;. She must be tired of something.. Round here she's always on my mind. Round here, Hey man, I got lots of time. Round here we're never sent to bed early. And nobody makes us wait. Round here we stay up very very very very late. I...

scarecrow,"Mary steers clear of the men from space. Back alley kid with an American face. She wants the wine, he brings a case. To carry them on through.

You're going on from me alone. You're going on, you're on your own. She was married alive in a Moscow surgery. Hoping to die in a Cold War nursery. All of the kids back home believe in much more than we do. It's a memory play where the memory fades. Into pictures you took, into records we played. Spy versus spy. Scarecrow and I. Out across the darkness where the bomberjets fly, singing. Spaceman, smokeshow, scarecrow, geronimo!. I wish you wouldn't go. I got the arms to reach you. I am the scarecrow. Do, do, do, do, do.

Endless alibis. And the reasons that need cleaning every night. Half a world away. You can't wash away the stain of the deceiving. And the things that you cannot believe, and well.... She don't want no one around. Cause she don't want anybody to see. What she looks like when she's down. Cause that's a really sad place to be. Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls.

To the highway crossing. I'll go lie. Down in the middle. Of the road. You think. That you can do. Without me. I can't do. Anything at all. You think. Tthat you can do. Without me. But I don't believe. In Sundays. And I don't believe. In anything at all. I don't believe. In Sundays. And I don't believe. In anything at all. I don't believe. In anything at all"
sweet home alabama,"Big wheels keep on turning. Carry me home to see my kin. Singing songs about the Southland. I miss Alabamy once again. And I think its a sin, yes. Well I heard Mister Young sing about her. Well, I heard ole Neil put her down. Well, I hope Neil Young will remember. A Southern man don't need him around anyhow. Sweet home Alabama.

the ballad of el goodo,"Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh. But I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds. It gets so hard at times like now to hold on. My guns they're waiting to be stuck by. At my side is God. And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. There's people around who tell you that they know. The places where they send you, and it's easy to go. They'll zip you up and dress you down. Stand you in a row. But you know you don't have to. You can just say no. And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. I've been built up and trusted. Broke down and busted. But they'll get theirs and we'll get ours. Just if we can. Just, ah, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Years ago my heart was set to live, oh. But I've been trying hard against strong odds. It gets so hard at times like now to hold on. Well, I'll fall if I don't fight. And at my side is God. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. [alternate lines of last verse:]. Years ago I was all set to go. And I've been trying hard against long odds. It gets so hard at times like this to even hang around. I can either stand or fall. And I believe I'm gonna stand tall"
the ghost in you,"A man in my shoes runs a light. All the papers lie tonight. But falling over you. Is the news of the day. Angels fall like rain. And love, is all of heaven way. Inside you the time moves and she dont fade. The ghost in you she dont fade away. The race is on, Im on your side. But hearing you my engines died. Im in the mood for you. Or for running away. All the stars come down in you. But love, love, love you cant give it away. Inside you the time moves and she dont fade. The ghost in you she dont fade. Inside you the time moves and she dont fade away. Dont you know she dont fade. Dont you go it makes no sense. And all these talking supermen. Just take away the time just to get it away. Aint it just like the rain. Cause love, love, love, love is only heaven away. Inside you the time moves and she dont fade. The ghost in you she dont fade away. Inside you the time moves and she dont fade away. The ghost in you she dont fade. A man in my shoes runs a light. But all the papers lie tonight. Falling over you is the news of the day. And love will not fade away. And love love love will not fade away"

I'd like to be a daisy. I'll stay up waiting for my dusky wife. to open and get high with just my jasmine baby. and every time she does it gets me crazy. the color of her head changing every day. a little breath of wind and I just get crazy. the greening of Americas progressing nicely. it's all right with me. -every time she. she does it I just get teary. the color of her head changing every day. a little breath of wind and she's always near me. the greening of Americas progressing smoothly. cuz she's choosing me"
they paved paradise,"They paved paradise and put up a parkin' lot. With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum. And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT. I don't care about spots on my apples,. LEAVE me the birds and the bees please. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Hey now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot. Why not?. Listen, late last night, heard the screen door slam. And a big yellow taxi took my girl away. Don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Well, don't it always seem to go. That you don't know what you got till it's gone. They paved paradise to put up a parking lot. Well now, they paved paradise. And put up a parking lot. I don't wanna give it. Why you wanna give it. Why you wanna givin it all away. Hey, hey, hey.

time and time again,"I wanted so badly. Somebody other than me. Staring back at me. But you were gone. I wanted to see you walking backwards. And get the sensation of you coming home. I wanted to see you walking away from me. Without the sensation of you leaving me alone. Time and time again. Time and time again. Time and time again. I can't please myself. I wanted the ocean to cover over me. I wanna sink slowly without getting wet. Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely. I'll walk on water every chance I get. Time and time again. Time and time again. Time and time again. I can't please myself. So when are you coming home. Sweet Angel?. You leaving me alone?. All alone?. Well, if I'm drowning darling. You'll come down this way on your own. I wish I was travelling on a freeway. Beneath this graveyard western sky. I'm gonna set fire to this city. And out into the desert. We're gonna ride. Time and time again. Time and time again. Time and time again. I can't please myself."
untitled (love song),If tonights the night then todays my day. And I should hang it all on display. Yours is just a losers game. And I decided that I should play. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. (Instrumental break). Felt the winds direction bringing change. Clouds so softly it will rain. And summer fell and the winter spring. And now its all a feeling. I cant get back again. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. (Instrumental break). Plotting thoughts against the clear blue sky. And the feeling came I felt like getting high. No sense to try to find my piece of mind. Cause maybe baby I was born to win dissatisfied. And you know your caring never dies so. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. Ah no ah no ah no. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. (Instrumental break). Come on yeah. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. Come on come on and try. Throw your arms around my neck. I wont be soon to forget. Not gonna have a rise. Throw your arms around my neck. Hold me hold me hold me. I wont be soon to forget. Gotta get out of my life. Throw your arms around my neck. Come on come on now shine. I wont be soon to forget
up all night (frankie miller goes to hollywood),"Is everybody happy now?. Is everybody clear?. We could drive out to the dunes tonight,. 'cause summer's almost here.. And I've been up all night,. I might sleep all day.. Get your dreams just right. Let them slip away,. I might sleep all day.. When the roads are clear,. We'll head on out of here,. If you're coming back,. I'll see you in the morning. I'm just staring at. the ceiling staring back at me,. Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me.... And I've been up all night,. I might sleep all day.. Get your dreams just right. And let them slip away,. I might sleep all day.. Ohhh...It's too late to get high now.. 2X. fix your hair just right. Put your jeans on tight,. Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy.. 'Cause I've been thinking I'd. like to see your eyes. open up real wide the minute that you see me.. If you don't come through,. I wouldn't wait for you.. I understand that everyone goes disappearing,. into the greatest grey. that covers over everyday,. and hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance.... I've been up all night,. I might sleep all day.. Get your dreams just right. let them slip away,. I might sleep all day.. Ohh...It's too late to get high now.. 2X. Baby I'm not alone. only wanna get high."
walkaways,"I've gotta rush away. she said, I've been to Boston before. and anyway, this change I've been feeling. doesn't make the rain fall. No big differences these days,. just the same old walkaways. Someday, Im gonna stay. but not today."
washington square,I sold my piano. It couldn't come with me. I locked up my bedroom. And I walked out into the air. When nothing I needed. Is left there behind me. I walk out through the shadows. Of Washington Square. Now I wander the highway. From Dublin to Berkeley. And I heard the songbirds. Of Valley Paurine. I love like a fountain. And it left me like nothing. Just the memories. Of walking through. Washington Square. Now I live in the shadows. Where light is electric. And time is just a number. That rests on a wall. Nobody knows me. My friends and my family. Are as far from this city. As Washington Square. So cover this warm night. In a blanket of starlight. I will follow this freeway. Out into the air. In case you should wonder. And wanted to find me. I'm traveling homeward. To Washington Square. In case you should wonder. I'm in Washington Square. Washington Square. Washington Square
we're only love,"Who built the ball that is this earth?. Gave me life, and water for my thirst.. Home for a heart till death from birth. And we're only love, at it's best or worst.. Love calling your name. I will live on. Calling your name. Who wrote the pages of our lives?. In black and white, and taught me wrong from right. It's your heart that held you tight. But we're only love. Spin me around and round and round. Love calling your name. I will live on. Calling your name. And the world seems like my enemy. The waterfall of frowns. And the wave of life will capture me. And I'm falling down upon love. C'mon now darling. I'm falling falling down on love. I'm falling down, falling down on love. I'm falling down on love. (Chorus)"
when i dream of michelangelo,"You know. I don't like you. But you want to be. My friend. There are bodies. On the ceiling. And they are. Ffluttering their wings. It's ok, I'm angry. But you'll never understand. You dream of Michelangelo. They hang above your hands. And I know. She is not my friend. And I know. Ccuz there she goes. Walking on my skin again. And I can't see why. You want to talk to me. When your vision of America. Is crystal and clean. I wanna white bread life. Just something ignorant. In the rain. But from the walls. Of Michelangelo. I'm dangling again. And I know. She is not my friend. And I know. Cuz there she goes. Walking on my skin. Again and again. Saturn on a line. The sun afire. Of strings and wires. Spin above my head. And make it right. Anytime you'd like. You can catch a sight. Of angel eyes on emptiness. And infinite. And I dream of Michelangelo. When I'm lying in my bed. I see God upon the ceiling. I see angels overhead. And he seems so close. As he reaches out his hand. We are never quite as close. As we are led to understand. And I know. She is not my friend. And I know. Ccuz there she goes. Walking walking walking. And I know. She is not my friend. And I know. Ccuz there she goes. Walking on my skin. Again and again. On my mind. Oh, Lord, no. Yes, she's walking. On my skin. Again and again"
why should you come when i call?,"It's 1:30 in the morning. that's alright by me. you just waiting by the phone. I should give a little warning. but I need the things I need. I'm not proud to need a hand. but I just don't understand. So, Why should you come when I call. I never say nothing at all. why do I go, when I go. it's leaving me here all alone. You ought to get out on your own. ain't necessarily a bad thing. to believe the things I say. cause you can make yourself feel good. you know it's really not a good thing. to give everything to me.

I'm used to waking up alone. And if you think about it. anyone you think about is a better love than me. but if you've not fallin' quite asleep?.

you ain't goin' nowhere,"Clouds so swift. Rain won't lift. Gate won't close. Railings froze. Get your mind off wintertime. You ain't goin' nowhere. Oo-ee! Ride me high. Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh no, are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair!. I don't care. How many letters they sent. Morning came and morning went. Pick up your money. And pack up your tent. You ain't goin' nowhere. Oo-ee! Ride me high. Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh no, are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair!. Buy me a flute. And a gun that shoots. Tailgates and substitutes. Strap yourself. To the tree with roots. You ain't goin' nowhere. Oo-ee! Ride me high. Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh no, are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair!. . Genghis Khan. He could not keep. All his kings. Supplied with sleep. We'll climb that hill no matter how steep. Just as soon as we get the hell up to it.

you can't count on me,"Anything's. Hard to change. But hey. I got you down. On your knees again. You watch the sky. It's a pale parade. Of passing clouds. That cover. The bed upon. Which we laid. In the dark. And the memories. That I made. Of a laughing girl. But you're just my toy. And I can't stop. Playing with you, baby. Chorus:. If you think. You need to go. If you wanted. To be free. There's one thing. You need to know. And that's that. You can't count on me. Coming along real good. But I still. Can't do most. Of the things I should. I watch the sky. Coming down to bury me. And I can't stop. This crawling. Out of my skin. I know that you see. Yourself flying in. Out of the sky. Coming down. To carry me. But. I won't come out. So. (Chorus). I watched all. Of the same parades. As they passed on the days. That you wish you'd stayed. All this pain gets me high. And I get off. And you know why. So. (Chorus 2x). Aw, you can't count on me. No, you can't count on me"
