dancer in the dark,"Fate lies ahead. Like the Sun will rise. The light has been gone, far too long. From your eyes. But you never changed, never played your part. And you have erased all the fear from your heart. And tried to forget. The light in your eyes keeps fading out. The Night's falling deeper in the heart. Hiding the truth and crashing down.

Run to your boy; let him feel your love. Before it's too late. The light in your eyes keeps fading out. The Night's falling deeper in the heart. Hiding the truth and crashing down. My baby's a dancer in the dark. Your sight in dying but you keep on trying to save your boy. You keep on lying but your false illusions will be destroyed. You heard it calling but you turned your face never played your part. You heard it singing but you danced away like a falling star. Dancer in the dark. Dancer in the dark. Dancer in the dark"
dangerous kind,You got me in this situation. You got me backed against the wall. Caught in a web of your creation. I bet you set me up to fall. Once I thought about it. I figured out your wicked ways. There’s no doubt about it. You’d sell your soul to seal the case. You’re the dangerous kind. Now look at what you’ve done to me. What you’ve done to me baby. You’ve gotta criminal mind. Your motive is to plant a seed. Now I’d kill for you baby. You gotta shady reputation. From bed to bed to man to man. Once you deliver your temptation. No one can stop your master plan. Don’t try to lie about it. I don’t believe a thing you say. The more you try to hide it. The more the lies show on your face. Chorus. I’ve been sleeping with the enemy. Now I’m doing the time. Paying up for the crime. Guess you took everything you could from me. Chorus

dead promises,The break of dawn kills all the beauty. The dead of night is drifting away. Should I stay and welcome the day. Or should I follow the one. And hide from the sun. The ray of light cuts like a razor. The blazing fire burns in my eyes. The day reveals the dreadful betrayer. And his wicked mind. Hide from the sun. And hide from the sun. Hide from the sun. Dead promises. Paintings of the world so pure. Ancient prophecies. Remains of the world so cruel. The time has come. To hide from the sun. Like a rat I run to the darkness. The ray of night embraces my mind. Afraid to look back in to the heartless. World of dust and blood. I'll hide from the sun. Hide from the sun. Hide from the sun. Dead promises. Paintings of the world so pure. Ancient prophecies. Remains of the world so cruel. The time has come. To hide from the sun. I know me better. I won't be as bitter. In my own heaven. I'll be gone forever. Won't fall back never. I won't crack ever. Won't lock back never. Dead promises. Paintings of the world so pure. Ancient prophecies. Remains of the world so cruel. The time has come. To hide from the sun

And thousand year of loneliness. Bless the path of righteousness. And walk the trails of holiness. The garden is dying. Somebody is lying

fool,I'm feeling restless and I don't know why. Feels like time is standing still. So many people and I'm feelin' shy. I would with pleasure pass away. (no one can complain).

I know I haven't got that dignity. This is my chance to be not me. CHORUS.

You say get ready for the last waltz. Chorus. I believe that no one in this world has the answers for me.. But still I hope that someone has heard.. Chorus"

live forever,Was it an angel. That knocked on my door?. Or was it the wind?. Was I still sleeping. Lost in a dream. Or was it you?. We swam in the fountains. Beneath the northern stars. We cried from the laughter. And died in each others' arms. Remember and live forever. Remember to live for love. I got back my letters. Ages ago. Your address unknown. I passed a stranger. Who had your eyes. Or was it you?. We ran through the graveyard. To catch the midnight sun. We danced drunk and naked. Until the sun was gone. Remember and live forever. Remember to live for love. Remember to live for love

lost and lonely,It feels like the end of time. Like something bad is coming. You've been living in the world of lies. Your see through walls are falling. It's getting hard to except that I'm losing you. I watch as you sleep. Your nightmares break the silence. I can tell that you're in too deep. Got your mind down to a science. And every time that I touch you. I'm losing you. You're the eve of my destruction. In the garden of fears. Why am I devastated. You through it all away. Now who's the one who's lost and lonely. I gotta break away from you. Who will pay for all the things you've done. I'm not the only one. You're out of control inside. I don't need x-ray vision. To see all the desperate signs. You made your heart a prison. I took it all out of fear of losing you. In the valley of deception. There is a river of tears. Chorus. So many nights. So many fights. So many days. Too easy to erase.

Someone's gonna light you up. Someone's gonna light you up. Someone's gonna light you up"

the fight,Everything is still and calm. In the dead of night. Right before for the fight. Clouds are gathering for the storm. Destiny decides. Who will live or die. I've been waiting for this moment. It's time for the battle. Even if I never make it. Take me home. I might never get my story. Carved in stone. But I will rise again. The fight is to the end. The pounding of the drums of war. Turns your tears to mud. Rivers turns to blood. If you live to see another day. To take another breathe. Make it life or death. Chorus. Give me strength to carry on. Till my life is done. Everybody wants the glory. But you better remember. The fight is to the end
the one i love,"Haven't slept in a week. My bed has become my coffin. Cannot breath, cannot speak. My head's like a bomb, still waiting. Take my heart and take my soul. I don't need them anymore. The one I love. Is striking me down on my knees. The one I love. Drowning me in my dreams. The one I love. Over and over again. Dragging me under. Hypnotized by the night. Silently rising beside me. Emptiness, nothingness. Is burning a hole inside me. Take my faith and take my pride. I don't need them anymore. The one I love. Is striking me down on my knees. The one I love. Drowning me in my dreams. The one I love. Over and over again. Dragging me under. This bed has become my chapel of stone. A garden of darkness to where I'm thrown. So take my life, I don't need it anymore. The one I love. Is striking me down on my knees. The one I love. Drowning me in my dreams. The one I love. Over and over again. Dragging me under. The one I love. Is striking me down on my knees. Is striking me down. Drowning me in my dreams. Down on my knees. Over and over again. Is striking me down. Over and over and over and over again"
time to burn,"Fear of the dark. Tears me apart. Won't leave me alone. And time keeps running out. Just want my life. I'm so sick and tired. I'm singing the blues. As you turn my life around. Come on!. Refrão:. Tell me why do I feel this way?. All my life I've been standing on the borderline. Too many bridges burned. Too many lies I've heard. Had a life, but I can't go back. I can't do that, it will never be the same again. And I know I don't have any time to burn. They follow me home. Disturbing my sleep. But I'll find a place. A place where they cannot find me. Maybe I'm lost. Maybe I'm scared. But too many times. I've closed the doors behind me. Refrão. Leave it all behind. Cross the borderline. Face the truth,. Don't have any time to.... Have any time to burn. Refrão"
