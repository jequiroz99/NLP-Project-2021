ghost in a ditch,"This ghost lay in a ditch on thursday. Where i was meant to be. I almost missed my death it's so good. Now he's decked in flowers for me. I hope she doesn't like me. Or i'll still be standing more than likely. Where he once stood. And that's not good. We pretend not to look at each other. But he could see over his shoulder. He got me a time,. He got that a time,. Never a time again. I noticed the hair on her head that's not real. Now i'm left with a dead and a naked ordeal. When all i want is down at the shore,. Sitting in my car. And bitter sometimes. But the taste is sweet. Your friends only like themselves in photographs. I don't like them,. I don't like you. We pretend not to care for another. I stand on my feet when i hold her. We pretend not to look at the change,. And for good i cry. So when the stars look bright above me,. And in the streetlights i can't see. I walk on down to make a stand,. Where he once stood. So now they lie there breast to breast and toe to toe. And all i want is down at the shore,. Sitting in my car. We end it, it's all over,. She'll marry me but i'll hold her. She shoveled the dirt into my face,. But i don't care. I love her"
