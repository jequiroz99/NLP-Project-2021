He's a-muckin' about with the angels above,. Not lost but gone before.. Do you want to do it again?."

Chorus. I'm beginning to see. What a fool you've made of me.. I might have to break the law when I find you.. Stop running away;. I've got a better game to play,. You know I can't go on living without you.. Chorus"
world of pain,"by Gail Collins and Felix Pappalardi. Outside my window is a tree.. Outside my window is a tree.. There only for me.. And it stands in the gray of the city,. No time for pity for the tree or me.. There is a world of pain. In the falling rain. Around me.. Is there a reason for today?. Is there a reason for today?. Do you remember?. I can hear all the cries of the city,. No time for pity for a growing tree.. Chorus. First Verse. Chorus."
wrapping paper,"Wrapping paper in the gutter. Moving slowly as the wind on the sea,. (Faces calling, waves moving). In your picture on a wall of a house of old times.. (Can you hear me) Can you hear me. (Can you hear me) Wandering sadly?. In the city, feeling pretty,. Down and out and making love to you on the shore,. (Ruined buildings, faces empty). In the picture as I gaze ahead and don't see. (That they're calling) That they're calling.. (That they're calling) Wandering sadly.. Shattered windows, stairs to nowhere.. (Hear you calling) Hear you calling. (Hear you calling) As I wander so sadly.. Wish I knew what you'd done to me;. Turned me on to things I never knew.. It's all broken, weeds are growing.. Wish I was going home to the house by the shore. (Where you loved me) Where you loved me,. (Where you loved me) Loved me so sadly.. Someday I'll get back, somehow I'll do it.. I'll arrive there and you'll be there to meet me.. (Walk together, tread the weeds down). Kiss again in the picture on the wall. (Where I loved you) In the old house.. (Where I loved you) Loved you so well."
you make me feel,"You make me feel like a hat stand. All tall, grim and brown. You make me feel like a clothes horse. Old and left out in the rain. You sure say you can. Also shared you with the others. I couldn't stand it. You make me feel like a deserted house. Dark and empty in the dusk. You made me feel like a charred foot. In a burnt out factory. You insist that I split. Cast me into the pit with the others. So many of them down there. Now it's so dark dark dark. Not a tiny spot of hope for me. Now I want you so much. I need a crutch by the time you set me free. Now it's so dark dark dark. Not a tiny spot of hope for me. Now I want you so much. I need a crutch by the time you set me free. You make me feel like a broken yellow yo-yo. Thrown away on a dump. You make me feel like a flower. Makin' way for a petrol pump. You ruined my days. With your poisoned ways. Like you did the others. So many others. Wonderin' down here. Hello man, how are things?. Dark isn't it?. What a woman?. Wonder when she'll let us out"
