all i wanna do,"Hit it!. This ain't no disco. This ain't no country club either,. This is L.A.. “All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die”. Says the man next to me out of nowhere. It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William. But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy. And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever. Had a day of fun in his whole life. We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday. In the bar that faces the giant car wash. And the good people of the world. Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks. Hosing and scrubbing as best they can. In skirts and suits. And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks. Back to the phone company, the record stores, too. Well, they're nothing like Billy and me. 'Cause. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard. I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning. Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of Bud. He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match. In an oversized pack letting each one burn. Down to his thick fingers before blowing and. Cursing them out, he's watching. The bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor. And a happy couple enters the bar. Dangerously, close to one another. The bartender looks up from his want ads. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard. Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night. And the car wash, too, the matches and the. Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,. The sun and the moon , 'Cause. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling the party has just begun. All I wanna do is have some fun. I won't tell ya, that you're the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard.

if it makes you happy,"I've been long, a long way from here. Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos. And drank til I was thirsty again. We went searching through thrift store jungles. Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo. And Benny Goodman's corset and pen. Well, o. k. I made this up. I promised you I'd never give up. . If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad. You get down, real low down. You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train. Well who hasn't been there before?.

I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home. . If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad. We've been far, far away from here.

sweet child o' mine,He's got a smile. And it seems to me. Reminds me of childhood memories. But everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky. Now and then when I see his face. It takes me away to that special place. And if I stand too long. I'll probably break down and cry. Sweet child 'o mine. Sweet love of mine. He's got eyes of the bluest skies. And if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. His hair reminds me. Of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine

But your demons and your angels reappeared. Leavin' all the traces of the man you thought you'd be. Leavin' me with no place left to go from here. Leavin' me so many questions all these years.

my favorite mistake,I woke up and called this morning. The tone of your voice was a warning. That you don't care for me anymore. I made up the bed we sleep in. I looked at the clock when you creep in. It's 6 AM and I'm alone. Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending. To the bad day I was just beginning. When you go all I know is. You're my favorite mistake. Your friends are sorry for me. They watch you pretend to adore me. But I'm no fool to this game. Now here comes your secret lover. She'll be unlike any other. Until your guilt goes up in flames. Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending. To the bad day I got used to spending. When you go all I know is. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake. Maybe nothing lasts forever. Even when you stay together. I don't need forever after. It's your laughter. Won't let me go so I'm holding on this way. Did you know. Could you tell. You were the only one. That I ever loved. Now everything's so wrong. Did you see me walking by. Did it ever make you cry. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake.

Chasing dragons with plastic swords. Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more. Scully and angel on the kitchen floor. And I'm calling Buddy on the ouija board. I've been thinking 'bout catching a train.

redemption day,"I've wept for those who suffer long,. But how I weep for those who've gone.. Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong,. But keep on killing.. It's in the soul to feel such things,. But weak to watch without speaking.. Oh what mercy sadness brings,. If God be willing.. There is a train that's heading straight. To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate.. And on the way, child and man. And woman wait, watch and wait.. For redemption day.. Fire rages in the streets,. And swallow everything it meets.. It's just an image often seen,. On television.. Come leaders, come you men of great,. Let us hear you pontificate.. Your many virtues laid to waste. And we aren't listening.. What do you have for us today,. Throw us a bone but save the plate.. Oh why we waited til so late,. Was there no oil to excavate. No riches in trade for the fate. Of every person who died in hate. Throw us a bone, you men of great.. There is a train that's heading straight. To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate.. And on the way, child and man. And woman wait, watch and wait.. For redemption day.. It's buried in the countryside,. It's exploding in the shells of night,. It's everywhere a baby cries,. Freedom, freedom.. Freedom, freedom.. Freedom.."

Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer to feeling fine. He's got a daughter he calls Easter. She was born on a Tuesday night. I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone. Why I'm a stranger in my own life. Jump in, let's go. Lay back, enjoy the show. Everybody gets high, everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes. [Chorus]. I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy. I've been living on coffee and nicotine. I've been wondering if all the things I've seen. Were ever real, were ever really happening. [Chorus]"

And if we turn around can we ever get back?. Chorus. You say it was there when we were young. Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box. And if it's true we lost our way. Then what have we got?. Chorus 2x. Today I saw the strangest thing"
it's only love,I think I met my match again. Standing round the candlelight. In the middle of this blizzard. You stood and melted all the ice o. [CHORUS:]. It's only love. It's only love. If only love comes round again. It will have been. Worth the ride o. You were master of so many. Savior to none. I waged all of my hopes so plenty on you. Now look what I've become. [CHORUS]. Sometimes lonely is not only a word. But faces I have known. And if you see me could you free me with a smile. So I can let go. [CHORUS].
a change would do you good,"Ten years living in a paperbag. Feedback baby, he's a flipped out cat. He's a platinum canary, drinkin' falstaff beer. Mercedes rule, and a rented lear. Bottom feeder insincere. Prophet lo-fi pioneer. Sell the house and go to school. Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel. A change would do you good. I think a change would do you good. God's little gift is on the rag. Poster girl posing in a fashion mag. Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde. Wear your fake fur on the inside. Queen of south beach, aging blues. Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes. I thought you were singing your heart out to me. Your lips were syncing and now I see. A change would do you good. I think a change would do you good. Chasing dragons with plastic swords. Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more. Scully and angel on the kitchen floor. And I'm calling Buddy on the ouija board. I've been thinking 'bout catching a train. Leave my phone machine by the radar range. Hello it's me, I'm not at home. If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone. A change would do you good. I thnk a change would do you good. Hello, it's me, I'm not at home. If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone. A change would do you good. Oohh, I think a change would do you good. (Sheryl Crow/Jeff Trott/Brian MacLeod)"

Bring it on home to me. Abilene. Isn't it good to be free o. Can't you see I'm wearing your shirt. The one with the heart on the sleeve. Everyone can see you've been hurt.

all by myself,"When I was young. I never needed anyone. And making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. Livin' alone. I think of all the friends I've known. When I dial the telephone.

all i wanna do,"Hit it!. This ain't no disco. This ain't no country club either,. This is L.A.. “All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die”. Says the man next to me out of nowhere. It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William. But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy. And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever. Had a day of fun in his whole life. We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday. In the bar that faces the giant car wash. And the good people of the world. Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks. Hosing and scrubbing as best they can. In skirts and suits. And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks. Back to the phone company, the record stores, too. Well, they're nothing like Billy and me. 'Cause. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard. I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning. Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of Bud. He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match. In an oversized pack letting each one burn. Down to his thick fingers before blowing and. Cursing them out, he's watching. The bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor. And a happy couple enters the bar. Dangerously, close to one another. The bartender looks up from his want ads. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard. Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night. And the car wash, too, the matches and the. Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,. The sun and the moon , 'Cause. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling the party has just begun. All I wanna do is have some fun. I won't tell ya, that you're the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard.

always on your side (feat. sting),"My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away. But every now and then you come to mind. Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game. But when your name was called, you found a place to hide. When you knew that I was always on your side. Well everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent. But your demons and your angels reappeared. Leavin' all the traces of the man you thought you'd be. Leavin' me with no place left to go from here. Leavin' me so many questions all these years. But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear. Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear. Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally. This isn't how it's really meant to be. No it isn't how it's really meant to be. Well they say that love is in the air, but never is it clear,. How to pull it close and make it stay. Butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away. And I'm left to carry on and wonder why. Even through it all, I'm always on your side. But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear. Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear. Or are we left to wonder, all alone, eternally. But is this how it's really meant to be. No is it how it's really meant to be. Well if they say that love is in the air, never is it clear. How to pull it close and make it stay. If butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away. Leavin' me to carry on and wonder why. Was it you that kept me wondering through this life. When you know that I was always on your side"

I don't know what I mean. [Chorus]. Am I. Am I. Getting Through. Am I. Am I. Getting Through. I am ignorant and rude. I am fashionably crude. And sometimes when it's quiet. I'm an angel in white. When I pose in the mirror. I want everyone near me. I am scared that I'm weird. I'm afraid I am queer. I am lovely and weak. I am foul when I speak. I am strange when I'm kind. I am frying my mind.

When the money starts to running out. Your esoteric rants. Were made to twist and shout. I heard you moved. Now you're hangin on the Moulin Rouge. Don't you know no matter where you go.

anything but down,"I light your cigarette, I bring you apples from the barn. How quickly you forget: I run the bath and pour the wine. I bring you everything that floats into your mind.

You say won't you come find me and yes is what i say. You don't bring me anything but down (2x). Everything is crashing to the ground. Well, maybe I'm not your perfect kind,. Maybe I'm not what you had in mind,. And maybe were just killing time. You with your silky words. And your eyes are green and blue. You with your still beliefs that don't match anything you do. It was so much easier before you became you. You don't bring me anything but down (2x). Everything just crashes to the ground. When you come around (2x). Well, no more playing seek and hide. No more long and wasted nights. Can't you make it easy on yourself?. I know you wish you were strong;. You wish you were never wrong,. Well I've got some wishes of my own."

I'm with you once more under the stars,. And down by the shore an orchestra's playing. And even the palms seem to be swaying. When they begin the beguine.. To live it again is past all endeavor,. Except when that tune clutches my heart,. And there we are, swearing to love forever,. And promising never, never to part.. What moments divine,. What rapture serene,. Till clouds came along to disperse. The joys we had tasted,. And now when I hear people curse. The chance that was wasted,. I know but too well what they mean;. So don't let them begin the beguine. Let the love that was once a fire. Remain an ember;. Let it sleep like the dead desire. I only remember. When they begin the beguine.. Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play. Till the stars that were there before return above you,. Till you whisper to me once more,. Darling, I love you!. And we suddenly know What heaven we're in,. When they begin the beguine"

carolina,Carolina. Her tears are falling like the spanish moss. Disappearing. Into beauty found in beauty lost. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight falling on a bed. And there can be no solice in remembering. The words we never said. Faded postcards. Of all the places she loves best. Take her far away. As she presses wrinkles from her cotton dress. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight falling on a bed. And there can be no solice in remembering. The words we never said. So it goes. The summer blooms and fades away. Like moonlight crashing to the earth. And there can be no solice in remembering. The way things never were.

Chances are we'll make it back. We'll make it back... We'll make it back. Terror runs for king I said. It is better to explore within. We were apes before we spoke of sin.

crash and burn,"I watched the sun come up on Portland. I waved goodbye to all my friends. I packed my car and headed to LA. I gave away all my loose ends. Somebody said you gotta get away. To wanna go back home again. I left my universe standing there. Holding the hand of my best friend. And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you. It's one more dusty rose about to turn. I'll see you when I reach New Mexico. If I'm in the mood to crash and burn. I wrote a letter that I never mailed. I rehearsed a dialogue in my head. In case you ever wanted to track me down. I'll take mycell phone to bed. And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes. And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn. I call you up when my bottle's dry. I'm on my way to crash and burn. Antigone laid across the road. And let a mack truck leave her there for dead. Just because her lover split the scene. Well love might be great but why lose your head. Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you. And my heart may break again before it learns. And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again. Cause I've gotten use to the crash and burn. I say I've gotten use to the crash and burn. (Sheryl Crow/Jeff Trott)."

Were ever real, were ever really happening. [Chorus]"

gasoline,"Way back in the year of 2017. The sun was growing hotter. And oil. Was way beyond it's peak. When crazy Hector Johnson. Broke into a refinery. And the black gold. Started flowing. Just like Boston tea. It was the summer. Of the riots. And London sat. In sweltering heat. And the gangs. Of Mini Coopers. Took the battle. To the streets. But when the creed. Was handed down. For no more trucks. And no more cars. They threw cans of petrol. Through the windows. At Scotland Yard. Gasoline. Will be free, will be free. Gasoline. Will be free, will be free. When the Mounties stormed. The palace of the Saudi family. They held them up for ransom. Without disturbing. Their high tea. But their getaway was shaky. They stalled. In the Riyadh streets. Cause you. Can't make it very far. When your tank is on empty. The final can of gasoline. Was loaded on a truck. And driven through. The streets of Agra. To the palace aquaduct. You see. All the majesty of worship. That once adorned. These fatal halls. Was just a target to the angry. As they blew up the Taj Mahal. Gasoline. Will be free, will be free. Gasoline. will be free, will be free. Gary ran a market. Way down in Tennessee. Where all the farmers. Got together. And talked about. This great country. But when the government. Turned. It's back on farming. Man, what I hear. They dragged the pumps. Out of the ground. With a big vintage. John Deere. I've got soldiers. On my payroll. Standing guard. On my front drive. Snipers on the roof. Poised at those. Who don't want me alive. Cause they audited my taxes. My family under threat. Cause I've got a message. And a megaphone. And I'll scream it. To the death. Gasoline. Will be free, will be free. Gasoline. Will be free, will be free. You got the farms. In Argentina. Making fuel. From sugar cane. You got the bastards. In Washington. Afraid of popping. The greed vain. Cause the money's. In the pipeline. And pipeline's. Running dry. And we'll be. The last to recognize. Where there's shit. There's always flies"
god bless this mess,"Daddy’s in the hallway. Hanging pictures on the wall. Mama’s in the kitchen. Making casseroles for all. My brother came home yesterday. From somewhere far away. He doesn’t look like I remember. He just stares off into space. He must’ve seen some ugly things. He just can’t seem to say. God bless this mess. God bless this mess. Got a job in town. Selling insurance on the phone. With Robert and Teresa. And two con men from back home. Everyone I call up doesn’t have the time to chat. Everybody is so busy doing this and doing that. Something has gone missing. And it makes me kinda sad, oh. God bless this mess. God bless this mess. God bless this mess. Heard about the day. that two skyscrapers came down. Firemen, policemen.

Into a war all based on lies, oh. God bless this mess. God bless this mess. God bless this mess. God bless this mess"
gold dust woman,Rock on- gold dust woman. Take your silver spoon. And dig your grave. Heartless challenge. Pick your path and I'll pray. Wake up in the morning. See your sunrise- loves- to go down. Lousy lovers- pick their prey. But they never cry out loud. Did she make you cry. Make you break down. Shatter your illusions of love. Is it over now- do you know how. Pick up the pieces and go home.. Rock on- ancient woman. Follow those who pale. In your shadow. Rulers make bad lovers. You better put your kingdom up for sale. Did she make you cry. Make you break down. Shatter your illusions of love. Is it over now- do you know how. Pickup the pieces and go home..

hundreds of tears,I stood in the warmth of the light. Chilled to the bone. Hundreds of faces in sight. Still I was alone. Door after door. And room after empty room. I've stood here before.

I've walked in and out of the fire. Between truth and lies. Now how many children watch. While one child crys. I'll tear down these walls. And watch while their souls are freed. I'll throw away pride. To drown in this endless sea. In the longest days and the darkest nights. Down the longest road there's a presence of light. I hear a voice that calls me. It's love's name I call. In the end. Hundreds of tears on the water. Mercy come rain down on me. In the longest days and the darkest nights. Down the longest road there's a presence of light. In the longest days and the darkest nights. Down the longest road there's a presence of light. I hear a voice that calls me. It's love's name I call. In the end. Hundreds of tears on the water.

indian summer,"The voices hanging in the air. The fingers running through my hair. You whisper in my ear, words Iâ€™m afraid to hear. You're sleeping on the wings of doves. Of melting in the heat of love. A voice that disappears, into the air. You said you found me, and never let me go, and until you do. No arms around me, to pull me away, away from you. Indian summer, I remember you. Indian summer, do you think of me too?. Like a moth to a flame, youâ€™re drawn to me with tender chains. You wrap me up so tight, and hold me all the night. Whoâ€™s the stranger come and gone, statues crying in the lawn. The fountain's frozen tears, bring back those years. Did you think you loved me, and do you want me now like you did back then. No moon above me, could make me feel this way, feel this way again. Indian summer, I remember you. Indian summer, do you think of me too?. Where do the seasons go when you let them slip away. Now the winds have changed from hot to cold today. Indian summer, Indian summer, I remember you, where are you now. Ohhh, Indian summer, I remember you. Indian summer, do you think of me, do you think of me too. Cause I remember you, Indian summer."

Well stick with me baby anyhow. Things should start to get interesting right about now. My clothes are wet, tight on my skin. Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in. I know that fortune is waiting to be kind. So give me your hand and say you'll be mine. The emptiness is endless, cold as clay. You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way. Well there's only one thing that I did wrong. I stayed in Mississippi a day too long. Yeah the only thing that I did wrong. Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long. The only thing that I did wrong. Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long. (Bob Dylan). ."

my favorite mistake,I woke up and called this morning. The tone of your voice was a warning. That you don't care for me anymore. I made up the bed we sleep in.

You're my favorite mistake. Your friends are sorry for me. They watch you pretend to adore me. But I'm no fool to this game. Now here comes your secret lover. She'll be unlike any other. Until your guilt goes up in flames. Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending. To the bad day I got used to spending. When you go all I know is. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake. Maybe nothing lasts forever. Even when you stay together. I don't need forever after. It's your laughter. Won't let me go so I'm holding on this way. Did you know. Could you tell. You were the only one. That I ever loved. Now everything's so wrong. Did you see me walking by. Did it ever make you cry. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake.

But before he leaves he slips the landlord the rent. You say, ""It's just a question of eliminating obstacles"". As you throw your dinner out the kitchen door. You say, ""I know how you try"". But honey, let's eat out tonight. No one said it would be easy. But no one said it'd be this hard. No one said it would be easy. No one thought we'd come this far.

Through the pouring rain. She's searching through the stations. For an unfamiliar song. And she's pictures all the places. Where she knows she still belongs. And she smiles the secret smile. Because she knows exactly how. To carry on. So run baby run baby run baby run. Baby run. From the old familiar faces and. Their old familiar ways. To the comfort of the strangers. Slipping out before they say. So long. Baby loves to run"

shine over babylon,"I walked the heat of seven hills. Endless talk of losing wills. Great highways in a constant melt. Men and women and children all have overbuilt. Buying bread and paying for none. Creatures of a waning sun. Teacher's hands are overrun. Clowns and gypsies have all but gone. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. Freedoms etched on Sacred pillars. Hollow stones of mindless filler. Can lead to madman oil drillers. Won't be long before we all are killers. Little boy lost way up the mountains. Cities drowning under boiling fountains. I dreamed of chilly, sunlit days. I was trembling in a golden haze. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. Celebrate the golden cow. Praise the bloated bank account. If there's a god where is he now. The precipice is slipping further out. Sanskrit message from the mounts. Leave your possession, hope abounds. There's nothing here for you to cry about. We're all just followers from here on out. I take the stage, I walk the planks. I sing these songs with little thanks. I wait for shouts from crazy cranks. I stand amidst the brown shirt ranks. I found my way to alexandria. Where gurus bubble up on gangea. Scavengers, they run up and hand ya. All the junk that should have damned ya. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. If everything in life was free. You'd float in your own reverie. The things that you could never see. Seal the gap between you and me. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon. You make me wanna. Shine over Babylon"

solidify,Pouring in and around the great wellspring. Of simple feeling. And I need bearings in the face of your. Cool cool fire. Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice. Makes my soul tired. And concrete is. As concrete doesn't. And voices can drown. Why should I. Why should I. Why should I. Why should I. Solidify. Make me real. So you can see me. I guess you thought. I'd hide the sun from my liquid thoughts and. Make ice for you. You thought I'd seed my clouds. With the rain of your personal dreams. I guess you thought I'd throw confetti. At your parade of lofty thoughts. I guess you thought I'd shine good morning. In some good morning Jack. Surprise. Why should I. Why should I. Why should I. Why should I. Solidify. Make me real. So you can see me. (Sheryl Crow/Kevin Hunter/Bill Bottrell/David Baerwald/Kevin. Gilbert/David Ricketts/Brian MacLeod).
solitaire,"There was a man,. A lonely man. Who lost his love. Through his indifference. A heart that cared. That went unshared. Until it died. Within his silence. And solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. A little hope. Goes up in smoke. Just how it goes,. Goes without saying. There was a man,. A lonely man. Who would command. The hand he's playing. And solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him takes him down. And by himself it's easy to pretend. He'll never love again. And keeping to himself he plays the game. Without her love, it always ends the same. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire."

To quietly pass me by. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine

there goes the neighborhood,Hey let's party. Let's get down. Let's turn the radio on. This is the meltdown. Get out the camera. Take a picture. The drag queens and the freaks. Are all out on the town. And cowboy Jane's in bed. Nursing a swollen head. [Chorus]. Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov. Don't like the scene any how. I dropped acid on a Saturday night. Just to see what the fuss was about. Now there goes the neighborhood. The photo chick made to look sickly. Is standing in her panties in the shower. She plays the guitar in the bathroom. While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers. And Schoolboy John's in jail. Making a killing through the U.S. mail. [Chorus]. This is the movie of the screenplay. Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie.. The messenger gets shot down. Just for carrying the message to a flunkie.. We can't be certain who the villans are 'cuz everyone's so pretty. But the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your. city. [Chorus]. There goes the neighborhood. There goes the neighborhood.
tombstone blues,"TOMBSTONE BLUES. The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course. The city fathers they're trying to endorse. The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse. But the town has no need to be nervous. The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits. To Jezebel the nun who violently knits. A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits. At the head of the chamber of commerce. Mama's in the fact'ry. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy's in the alley. He's lookin' for the fuse. I'm in the streets. With the tombstone blues. The hysterical bride in the penny arcade. Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made"". Then she sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade. Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in"". Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside. He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride. ""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride. You will not die, it's not poison"". Mama's in the fact'ry. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy's in the alley. He's lookin' for the fuse. I'm in the streets. With the tombstone blues. Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief. Looks up to his hero the Commander-in-Chief. ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief. Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"". Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly. Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry"". And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky. Saving, ""The sun is not yellow it is chicken"". Mama's in the fact'ry. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy's in the alley. He's lookin' for the fuse. I'm in the streets. With the tombstone blues."
tomorrow never dies,"Darling I'm killed. I'm in a puddle on the floor. Waiting for you to return. Oh what a thrill. Fascinations galore. How you tease, how you leave me to burn. It's so deadly my dear. The power of having you near. Until the day.... Until the world falls away. Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes. I See it in your eyes. Tomorrow Never Dies. Darling you won. It's no fun. Martini's, girls and guns. It's murder on our love affair. It's you , that's your life. Every night, as you chase the morning light. You're not the only spy out there. It's so deadly my dear. The power of wanting you near. Until the day.... Until the world falls away. Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes. I See it in your eyes. Tomorrow Never Dies. Until the day.... Until the day.... Until the day...."
try not to remember,Try to erase. the smell of freedom. and every face. that happened to meet mine. What still remains. something unrealenting. i'll say the names. of those I left behind. Chorus:. In the still of the night. do you laugh do you cry. do you try not to remember?. if it's a question of fate. do you love do you hate. do you try not to remember?. I see your eyes. in my own reflection. these broken skys. begin begin to mend. We are the same. fighting for something. whats left to gain?. theres no means to an end. Chorus:. In the still of the night. do you laugh do you cry. do you try not to remember?. if it's a question of fate. do you love to you hate. do you try not to remember?
we do what we can,"Downstairs they're playing Kenton. The house set to swing. I lay in my bed. And listen to everything. Cause Leo's in rare form tonight. His trombone sings so sweet. This is the room. Where they all come to meet. He said. I do what I can. I live for the moment. And that's who I am. Yeah that's who I am. And isn't it good. If we could freeze moments in time. We all would. But I do what I can. I do what I can. Downstairs he's playing Kenton. The Magnavox sighs. But oh how the music has changed. In all of our lives. He says ""nobody listens. To modern jazz"". And I'll never have what those guys have. He says. I do what I can. I work for a living. And that's who I am. Yeah that's who I am. And it's good to be alive. But everything's different since Leo died. I do what I can. Is this the end of the modern world. What could it mean for a young girl. Who sees the pain on his face. He does what he can. The procession on the TV screen. What could it possibly mean for a man. Who's come this far just to turn around. Could there still be life in Kenton's swing. With the Kennedys gone and everything. Those sad rows of houses with their optimistic colors. Democrat grandparents and draft-dodging brothers. Riots down the street and discontented mothers. We do what we can. Downstairs it's quiet. Less alive somehow. Somehow he was everything that I am now. And he says. I do what I can. I work for a living. And that's who I am. And that's who I am. But it's good to be alive. And these are the choices. We make to survive. You do what you can. (Sheryl Crow/Bill Bottrell/Kevin Gilbert/Dan Schwartz)."
weather channel,Sunny morning. You can hear it. Siren's warning. There is weather on both sides. And I know it's coming. Just like before. There's a black dog. That scratches my door. He's been growling my name saying. You better get to running. Can you make it better for me. Can you make me see the light of day. Because I got no one. Who will bring me a. Big umbrella. So I'm watching the weather channel. And waiting for the storm. It's just sugar. Just a pill to make me happy. I know it may not fix the hinges. But at least the door has stopped it's creaking. I got friends. They're waiting for me to comb out my hair. Come outside and join the human race. But I don't feel so human. Can you make it better for me. Can you make me see the light of day. Because I got lab coats. Who will bring me a panacea. While I'm watching the weather channel. Waiting for the storm. You won't want me. Hanging around the birthday pony. Even though it's just a game. You know we are the same. But you're the better faker..
what does it matter,"Baby, why do they say the things they say. Would it be easier to live the way they say we should. Maybe, cannot but wonder back this way. Yours are the only arms that make me feel like something can be good. I believe itâ€™s just a fact of life. Unless they wear our shoes to them itâ€™s black and white. Ooohhhh. Just what does it matter anyway. What side of the road weâ€™re standing on. And just what does it matter anyway. If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone. If nothing changes after we are gone. Baby, donâ€™t let them rob you of your pride. Thereâ€™s not a thing I wouldnâ€™t do to make this easier for you. Maybe, every now and then I laugh and cry. Itâ€™s getting harder now for me to separate the two. Where does innocence turn in to make believe. Cause make believe thereâ€™s no one here but me and you. Ohhh. Just what does it matter anyway. What side of the road weâ€™re standing on. And just what does it matter anyway. If you throw my love away because the world donâ€™t think itâ€™s right. And they may never understand. And you can't change the minds of those who are blind. Unless you give them sight. And the world lies in your hand. Tell me, and just what does it matter anyway. If in the long run nothing changes after we are gone. If nothing changes after we are gone."
what i can do for you?,"I'm so glad you're awake. That you're not like the others. Cause they're so straight-laced. And no fun. Gosh that's nice. That lingerie. Makes me feel like. Oh, I don't know. You're a very pretty thing. You remind me of someone. You must have heard. Some awful nasty things about me, but. What I can do for you. There's no one else. On God's green earth can do. What I can do for you. There's no one else. On God's green earth can do. Just ask anybody. They'll tell you that it's true. There's no one else on earth. Can do the things that I can do for you. You're never gonna make it. All by yourself. You're gonna need a friend. You're gonna need my help. I have so much to offer. If you just be nice. If you do what I say. And don't make me say it twice. Do you mind if I just. Rub my hand up thus. Come on just my hand. Come on just my hand. You got to understand. I'm gonna be your man. I'm gonna be your man. You're gonna need me. (David Baerwald/Sheryl Crow)"
when love is over,I know I ask for nothing. And thatâ€™s what I got from you tonight. I guess I thought youâ€™d changed. Leaving becomes too easy. Easy by morning light. I still cannot explain. Is it enough to ask and not receive. Just one more kiss before you turn and leave. When love is over. Over it should be. But something still burns in me. A hundred solid reasons. The answers come in waves. But I'm all for calmer seas. Youâ€™re only lost in the shuffle. But in your usual way. Itâ€™s you who always comes to me. Iâ€™ve burned up pages. Hidden yesterdays. Hereâ€™s one more glance before I turn away. When love is over. Over it should stay. But something wonâ€™t go away. Hardly a moment passes. Hardly a single day goes by. Iâ€™m not remembering. Just to surrender slowly. Into a strangerâ€™s arms. But you stand watching in the wings. These must be days weâ€™ve seen through tear-filled eyes. It all makes painful sense when I realize. When love is over. Something has to die. Cause you can say goodbye.
where has all the love gone?,"Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news. A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on. And even though I'm trying to smile. With everything I see it could take a while. Chorus:. I've been looking everywhere I go. Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?. I've been looking all around to know. Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?. Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes. Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on. Along the way we got off track. And if we turn around can we ever get back?. Chorus. You say it was there when we were young. Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box. And if it's true we lost our way. Then what have we got?. Chorus 2x. Today I saw the strangest thing"
white room,"[Clapton]. In the white room with black curtains by the station.. Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.. Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.. Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment.. [Crow]. I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;. Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.. [Clapton]. You said no strings could secure you at the station.. Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.. I walked into such a sad time at the station.. When I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.. [Crow]. I'll sleep in this place where the sun never shines;. Wait in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.. [Clapton]. At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.. Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.. Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.. Now she's dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.. [Crow]. I'll wait in the queue where the trains come around;. Wait here with you where the shadows run from themselves.."
wildflower,"Quiet eyes. You have always been my wildflower. Showing up wherever beauty's lost its way. Your heart must break. I was free. Until I heard the song you sang me to me. Pulling me away from everything I knew. To be with you. And everything I know just fades away. And every time you go it hurts me so. I don't know why when I know we're free. Free to fly. Here we are. Burning faster than the closest star. Falling back down to the Earth. I love you so it sometimes hurts. Closer still. You will find me standing on the hill. Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide. Now, come inside. And everything I know just fades away. And every time you go it hurts me so. I don't know why when I know we're free. Free to fly. And everything I know just fades away. And where the wildflower grows it picks its space. And that's the way it is when nature plays its lovely hand. We'll understand everything. Everything, everything"
woman in the white house,"Don't you think it's time. We put a woman in the White House. With a whole new attitude. We could use a little female common sense. Down on Pennsylvania Avenue. After 230-something years of waiting. It's way past overdue. Yeah, I think it's time we put a woman in the White House. Girls, how about you?. Well we like to spend money. But not money we ain't got. And we can balance a checkbook. And girls let me tell you what. It's time to clean up Capitol Hill. With a shovel and a pair of high heels. We've seen what the good ol'boys can do. Now it's our turn to take a shot. Don't you think it's time. To put a woman in the White House. With a whole new attitude. We could use a little female common sense. Down on Pennsylvania Avenue. After 230-something years of waiting. It's way past overdue. Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House. Girls, how about you?. There'd be a lot less fussing. And fighting and carrying on. There'd be a lot more loving. And listening and getting along. Just look at the mess we're in. Heck, I'd vote for Loretta Lynn. I guarantee that we'd all be. Singing a different song. Don't you think it's time. We put a woman in the White House. With a whole new attitude. We could use a little female common sense. Down on Pennsylvania Avenue. After 230-something years of waiting. It's way past overdue. Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House. Girls, how about you?. Well after 230-something years of waiting. It's way past overdue. Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House. Girls, how about you?. I think it's time we put a woman in the White House. Girls, how about you?"

For I've learned. That reality is only opinion. We disagreed, dear. Some opinions can't persuade. Crazy. My thinkin' was hazy. Placin' you. In the kitchen with apron and skillet preparing me dinner. But to serve's not your fortay. Lonely. I bet I was only. Lookin' in your direction for some small affection. But you made me love you. Cuz you always get your way. Always always. Isn't it boring?. Day after day. After day. After day. After day. Your suspicion. And all my ambition. Creates nothing less than an incredible mess. So I guess good luck darlin'. Is all I have to say. Kill me. You said you'd kill me. Baby those are just words. That in anger. You say but I surely would hate it. If you ever got your way. And you always get your way. You always get your way."
