brown eyed girl,"Hey where did we go. Days when the rains came. Down in a hollow. Playin' a new game. Laughin' and a runnin' hey hey. Skippin' and a jumpin'. In the misty mornin' fog. With our, our hearts a thumpin'. And you my brown eyed girl. You my brown eyed girl. And what ever happened. To Tuesday and so slow. Gone down the old mine with a. Transistor radio. Standin' in the sunlight laughin'. Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall. Slippin' and a slidin'. All along the waterfall. With you my brown eyed girl. You my brown eyed girl. Do you remember when. We used to sing. Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da (just like that). Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da. La ti da. So hard to find my way. Now that I'm all on my own. I saw you just the other day. My, you have grown. Cast my memory back there Lord. Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it. Makin' love in the green grass. Behind the stadium.

reminds me of you,"I miss you so much, I can't stand it. Seems like my heart, is breaking in two. My head says no but my soul demands it. Everything I do, reminds me of you. I miss you so much, in this house full of shadows. While the rain keeps pouring down, my window too. When will the pain, recede to the darkness. From whence it has come, and I'm feeling so blue. Ain't goin'down, no more to the well. Sometimes it feels like, I'm going to hell. Sometimes I'm knocking, on your front door. But I don't have nothing, to sell no more. Seems like the spirit, is pushing me onwards. I'm able to see, where I tripped and went wrong. I'll just have to guess, where my soul will find comfort.

sometimes we cry,"Sometimes we know, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we give, sometimes we won't. Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're wrong. Sometimes we cry. Sometimes it's bad when the going gets tough. When we look in the mirror and we want to give up. Sometimes we don't even think we'll try. Sometimes we cry. Well we're gonna have to sit down and think it right through. If we're only human what more can we do. The only thing to do is eat humble pie. Sometimes we cry. 'Fore they put me in a jacket, and they take me away. I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray. Sometimes we live, sometimes we die. Sometimes we cry. Sometimes we can't see anything straight. Sometimes everybody is on the make. Sometimes it's lonely on the lost highway. Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry. Gonna put me in a jacket, and take me away. I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray. Sometimes we live, sometimes we die. Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry. Sometimes we live, sometimes we die. Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry."

madam george,"Down on Cyprus Avenue. With a child-like vision leaping into view.. The clicking clacking of the high-heeled shoes,. Ford and Fitzroy; Madam George.. Marching with the soldierboy behind. He's much older now with hat on, drinking wine. And the smell of sweet perfume comes drifting thru. In the cool night breeze like Shalimar. And then your self control lets go. And suddenly you're up against the bathroom door.. The hallway lights are finely getting dim. You're in the front row touching him. And outside they're making all the stops. The kinds out in the streets collecting bottle tops,. Going for cigarettes and matches to the shops,. Happy talking, Madam George. And that's when you fall, Oh,. Oh, that's when you fall. And you fall into a trance. Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance. With your folded arms in history books you glance. Into the eyes of Madam George. And you think you've found your bag,. You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag. And in the corner playing dominoes in drag,. The one and only Madam George. And outside the frosty window raps. She says ""Be cool, I think that it's the cops"". Stands up, drops everything she gots,. It's not easy now you know. Now you know you gotta go. Catch a train from Dublin up to Sandy Row,. In the wind, rain & fog & slush & snow. Keep on going on. Say good-bye we know you're pretty far out. And all the little boys comin' round. They got gold cigarette lighters in their pockets. Walking away from it all, so cool.. That's when you fall.. Fade."

When I was high at the party, everything looked good. I was seein' through rose coloured glasses. Not seein' the wood for the trees. I started out in normal operation. But I just ended up in doubt. All my drinking buddies, they locked me out. I'm not feelin' it no more, I'm not feelin' it anymore. No feelin' it no more, I'm tryin' to give you the score. You see me up there baby, I'm on the screen. But I know better now, it's so unreal. If this is success, then something's awful wrong. `Cause I bought the dream and I had to play along. I'm not feelin' it no more, I'm not feelin' it anymore. I'm tryin' to give you the score, I'm not feelin' it no more. We all know that money, don't buy you love. You just get a job and somewhere to live. You have to look for happiness, within yourself. And don't go chasin' thinkin' that it is somewhere else. I'm not feelin' it no more, I'm not feelin' it anymore. Baby I'm tryin' to give you the score,. I'm not feelin' it no more. I was pretending all the time. I was givin' everybody what they wanted. And I lost my peace of mind. And all I ever wanted was simply just to be me. All you ever need is the truth. And the truth will set you free. I'm not feelin' it no more, I'm not feelin' it anymore. I'm tryin' to give you the score, just like I did before. I'm not feelin' it no more, I'm not feelin' it anymore. I'm not feelin' it no more, baby I'm just trying to give you the score.

I d like to be somewhere else. Like to be all by myself. Like to be down at the beach. Relaxing at the sugar shack. Hot dogs coffee black. Coca cola kicking back. I'm just a wild and crazy guy. But I m tearing at the seams. Before you can say Jack Robinson. I'll be seeing you in my dreams. She's on a blanket with a book. In the shade, white suit. Happy hour at the bar. And I m jamming with some friends. We're up to the same tricks. Drinking cocktails getting our kicks. Later on by the pool. Looking good ah, be cool. There's no craic double back. Moving on down the track. Moving on down the line. Got to chill out in style. Got to ease my troubled mind. Thinking just might be a crime. All work and no play. Makes Jack a dull chap. When it comes to the crunch. It's too much I've got to stop. No pain no gain it's all going. Down the drain."

ancient highway,"There's a small cafe on the outskirts of town. I'll be there when the sun goes down. Where the roadside bends. And it twists and turns. Every new generation. And I'll be praying to my higher self. Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground. There's a roadside jam playin' on the edge of town. In a town called Paradise near the ancient highway. When the train whistle blows. All the sadness that Hank Williams knows. And the river flows. Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns. In a factory in a street called Bread in East Belfast. Where Georgie knows best. What it's like to be Daniel in the lion's den. Got so many friends only most of the time. When the grass is high and the rabbit runs. Though it's talkin' to you and I. And every new generation comes to pay. The dues of the organ grinder jam. And the grinder's switch of the sacrifice. Everybody made to be rational with understanding. And I'll be praying to my higher self. Oh, don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground. What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt. That won't go away no matter how hard they try. They've got to pay time and time again, time and time again. I'll be praying to my higher self. And I'll be standin' there, where the boats go by. When the sun is sinking way over the hill. On a Friday evening when the sun goes down. On the outskirts of town, I wanna slip away. I wanna slip away, got to get away. And I'll be praying to my higher self. Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground, don't let me down. You'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again. By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes.

Travelling like a stranger in the night, all along the ancient highway. Got you in my sights, got you on my mind. I'll be praying in the evening when the sun goes down. Over the mountain, got to get you right in my sight. As the beams on the cars from the overpass. On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night. Like diamonds in the night. I'll be praying to my higher self, to my higher self. Don't let me down, don't let me down. And you'll be standing there, while the boats go by. While the boats go by on a Friday evening. Shining your light, shining your light on a Friday evening. Got to slip away, got to slip away down that ancient highway. In a town called Paradise, in a town, in a town. All along, all along that road, all along that road,. All along that road with the trancelike vision. I'll be praying to my higher self, don't let me down, don't let me down. Keep my feet on the ground, keep my feet on the ground,. Keep my feet on the ground. Friday evening got to slip away. Watching the view from a car from the overpass. And we're driving down that ancient road. Shining like diamonds in the night, oh diamonds in the night. All along the ancient highway. Got you in my sight, got you in my mind. Got you in my arms and I'm praying, and I'm gonna pray. I'm gonna pray, to my higher self, ah don't let me down. Don't let me down, give me the fire, ah give me the fire."

Pitter patter the rain falling down. Little glamor sun coming round. Take a walk when autumn comes to town. Little stroll past the house on the hill. Some more coal on the fire will do well. And in a week or two it'll be Halloween. Set the page and the stage for the scene. Little game the children will play. And as we watch them while time away. Look at me and take my breath away yeah. You'll be smiling eyes beguilding. And the song on the breeze. Will call my name out and your dream. Chestnuts roasting outside as you walk. With your love by your side. The old accordion man plays mellow and bright. And you go home in the crispness of the night. Little later friends will be along. And if you feel like joining the throng. Just might feel like singing Autumn song. Just may feel like singing Autumn song. You'll be smiling. Eyes beguilding. And the song on the breeze. Calls my name out in your dream. Chestnuts roasting outside. As you walk with your love by your side. And the old accordion plays mellow and bright. And you go home in the crispness of the night."

back street affair,You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me. And with all your young heart you learned to care. It brought you shame and disgrace.

While the one I was tied to was the first to be untrue. How can they call our love a back street affair. Well we have each other now. That's all that matters anyhow. While the judgement of gossips never fair. We'll just be brave and strong. Then someday they'll see they're wrong. So let them call our love a back street affair. We'll be free to love someday. When all the talk has died away. And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share. And I'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cry. That our love is not a back street affair

When you couldn't hear a bird, it was making not a sound. They were trying to muscle in, an easy way to bring the money in. You were puking up your guts. When you looked at the standard contract you just signed. Prostitution on the run, 'cepting when it was soliciting. Tryin' to drain them all dry, got hung up by the rope. Magazines and books, clearly undefinable. Wiped the clean slate, and pulled the rug from underneath her feet. I remember the day, the ""Drumshanbo Hustle"". When you couldn't hear no birds, 'cos they were making not a sound. They were trying to muscle in, the recording and the publishing. You were puking up your guts. When you read the standard contract you just signed, alright!. New York hooker by the neck, reads your Tarot cards and astronomy. Hey, I want to get your stars but don't know your sign. It was taking time to get the message through to it. But will hand down shake you one, and a letter five ""T"" rhyme. No sign poker. Oh, remember the day, the 'Drumshanbo Hustle'. Couldn't hear a bird, Lord, you couldn't hear no sound. They were trying to muscle in. On the gigs and the recording and the publishing. You were puking up your guts. When you read the standard contract you just signed. You were puking up your guts. When you read the standard contract that you signed. You were puking up your guts.

You're way over the line. This time you're out of your mind. This time you're out of your depth. And to the window you crack open. Oh but there's nowhere to go. There's only sleet and there's snow. Keep on movin' on a fast train. You hear they're goin' over the line. Oh standin' on the edge of the hill. Oh nobody on their wavelength. Nobody to give you a helping hand. And you start breakin' down. When you hear the sound. Keep on movin' on a fast train. I'm goin' nowhere on a fast train. Goin' nowhere. Goin' nowhere on a fast train. Goin' nowhere on a fast train.

for mr. thomas,"From faded newsprint used to wrap a fish. Inscrutably the muse selects your face. As I sit drinking famously in an Irish bar. Five thousand miles and thirty years away. With the usual ceremonial you were crowned one night. King of the field where doctors nail the cows. To make of the cock's quill the rights of language. And the pricking heart a sword against the hours. Let smirking scholars writhe in their favourite bondage. And hold you plaintiff to the charge of art. Exhibit A: he falls on legendary lines. Singing mother I don't want a pain here in my heart. The judge in me sucks eggs and jerks the sacred meat. But the boy in me still dreams in Milk Wood town. Like two provincial bastards playing the galleries. I hold your photo to a mirror upside down. And as bacon wafts through hungry streets, your ghost pervades. Just like an old ex-boxer aged twenty two. Staged-up like Falstaff or the wild welsh Rimbaud. You'd laugh to see the monograms they make of you. Ah, Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight fair. Let us throw old bottles at the ferris wheel. Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight. Let us steal whatever we are supposed to steal. Let us watch while the days grow daily more mundane. That rough God go riding with his shears. Hack wide the belly of the swollen mountains. And rip molten heroes forth from their furious tears. Oh, Mr. Thomas, oh, Mr. Thomas,. Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal. Mr. Thomas, oh, Mr. Thomas,. Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel. Oh, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thomas,. Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel. Oh, Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight.

I spied you from a foreign window. When the lilacs were in bloom. And the sun shone through your window pane. To the place you kept your books. You were reading on your sofa. You were singin' every prayer. That the masters had instilled in you. Since Lord Byron loved despair. In the palace of the Lord. In the palace of the Lord. Bridge:. And if you get it right this time. You don't have to come back again. And if you get it right this time. There's no need to explain. I saw you from a foreign. Bearing down the sufferin' road. You were carryin' your burden. You were singing about Rimbaud. I was going down to Geneva. When the Kingdom had been found. I was giving you protection. From the loneliness of the crowd. In the palace of the Lord. In the palace of the Lord. They were giving you religion. Breaking bread and drinking wine. And you laid out on the green hills. Just like when you were a child. I saw you from a foreign window. You were trying to find your way back home. You were carrying your defects. Sleeping on a pallet on the floor. In the palace of the Lord. In the palace of the Lord. In the palace of the Lord.

Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate. Keep me moving in this restless state. Sometimes it feels like I don't have any goal. It's just the gypsy. Catch that train, jump on that plane. Here and there and back again. Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate. Keep me moving, moving in permanent restless state. Seems like some days I don't have any goal. It's just the gypsy in my soul. Gypsy in my soul. Gypsy in my soul"

Put your money where your mouth is. Then we can get something going. In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime. And leave one or two cards showing.
haunts of ancient peace,"Beside the garden walls,. We walk in haunts of ancient peace.. At night we rest and go to sleep. In haunts of ancient peace.. The love and light we seek,. The words we do not need to speak,. Here in this wondrous way we keep. These haunts of ancient peace.. Let us go there again. When we need some relief. Oh, when I can't find my feet. When I need rest and sleep.. The Sunday bells they chime. Around the countryside and towns. A song of harmony and rhyme. In haunts of ancient peace.. The holy grail we seek. On down by haunts of ancient peace.. We see the new Jerusalem. In haunts of ancient peace.. Oh, when I can't find my feet. Oh, when I need some relief. One more time again.. You know I want to go there one more time again.. Be still in haunts of ancient peace.. (Be still)."

high summer,"By the mansion on the hillside. Red sports car comes driving down the road. And pulls up into the driveway. And a story does unfold. She's standing by the rhododendrons. Where the roses are in bloom. Looking out at the Atlantic ocean. And in her head she hums this tune. Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again. 'Cos high summer has got me down. I'll wait till the end of August. And get off this merry-go-round. And they shut him out of paradise. Called him Lucifer and frowned. She took pride in what God made him. Even before the angels shot him down to the ground. He's a light out of the darkness. And he wears a starry crown. If you see him, nothing will shake him. 'Cos high summer has got him low down. High summer's got him lonesome. Eyen when he makes the rounds. There's been no two ways about it. High summer's got him low down. Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside. Settled down to start a new. Far away from the politicians. And the many chosen few. Far away trom the jealousy factor. And everything that was tearing him apart. Far away from the organ grinder. And everyone that played their part. And they shut him out of paradise. Called him Lucifer and frowned. 'Cos he took pride in what God made him. Eyen before the angels shot him to the ground. He's a light out of the darkness. And he wears a starry crown. If you see him nothings shaken. 'Cos high summer's got him low down. High summer's on the rebound. High summer's got him low down. High summer's on the rebound. High summer's got him down, low down. High summer's on the rebound. High summer's got him low down. Low down."

in the garden,"The streets are always wet with rain. After a summer shower when I saw you standin'. In the garden in the garden wet with rain. You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow. As we watched the petals fall down to the ground. And as I sat beside you I felt the. Great sadness that day in the garden. And then one day you came back home. You were a creature all in rapture. You had the key to your soul. And you did open that day you came back to the garden. The olden summer breeze was blowin' on your face. The light of God was shinin' on your countenance divine. And you were a violet colour as you. Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden. The summer breeze was blowin' on your face. Within your violet you treasure your summery words. And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine. Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden. And you went into a trance. Your childlike vision became so fine. And we heard the bells inside the church. We loved so much. And felt the presence of the youth of. Eternal summers in the garden. And as it touched your cheeks so lightly. Born again you were and blushed and we touched each other lightly. And we felt the presence of the Christ. And I turned to you and I said. No Guru, no method, no teacher. Just you and I and nature. And the father in the garden. No Guru, no method, no teacher. Just you and I and nature. And the Father and the. Son and the Holy Ghost. In the garden wet with rain. No Guru, no method, no teacher. Just you and I and nature and the holy ghost. In the garden, in the garden, wet with rain. No Guru, no method, no teacher. Just you and I and nature. And the Father in the garden."

Where no freedom is the rule. Now I spend all my time just trying. To make it understood. It once was my life, that's what everybody said. All the things I used to do and the people that were friends. I've got to make it mean something at the end of the day. It once was my life, they can't take that away.

Then it became something else, and now it's incomplete. I'm just trying to get back to when. Can somebody please shed some light. It used to be my life, it used to be uptight. Trials and tribulations and stupidity still rules. Some days it just feels like I'm on a ship of fools. I'm back here on the boards, I can hear the engines roar. Everybody's got to pay, some people got to pay more. Well you can tell the people anything. Spoon feed them anything you like. It used to be so simple, it used to be my life. Now everything is so complicated, just to speak or use the phone. Some people try to use me, just 'cause they don't have their own. Don't know who's round the corner, trying to sell me some more tripe. It used to be my life, it used to be my life......"

Oh, the water. Oh, the water. Get it myself from the mountain stream. Chorus"

let the slave,"(Incorporating The Price Of Experience. Text: William Blake). Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field. Let him look up into the heavens and laugh in the bnght air. Let the inchained soul, shut up in darkness and in sighing. Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary Years. Rose and look out; his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open;. And let his wife and children return from the oppressor's scourge. They look behind at every step and believe it is a dream. Singing: The sun has left his blackness and has found a fresher morning. And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear and cloudless night. For empire is no more and now the Lion and Wolf shall cease. For everything that lives is holy. For everything that lives is holy. For everything that lives is holy. For everything that lixes is holy. What is the price of Experience? Do men buy it for a song?. Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No, it is bought with the price. Of all that a man hath, his house, his wife, his children. Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy. And in the wither'd field where the farmer plows for bread in vain. It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun. And in the vintage and to sing on the waggon loaded with corn. It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted. To speak the laws of prudence to the homeless wanderer. To listen to the hungry raven's cry in wintry season. When the red blood is fill'd with wine and with the marrow of lambs. It is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements. To hear the dog howl at the wintry door, the ox in the slaughter house moan;. To see a god on every wind and a blessing on every blast. To hear sounds of love in the thunder storm that destroys our enemies' house;. To rejoice in the blight that covers his field. And the sickness that cuts off his children. While our olive and vine sing and laugh round our door. And our children bring fruits and flowers. Then the groan and the dolor are quite forgotten. And the slave grinding at the mill. And the captive in chains and the poor in the prison. And the soldier in the field. When the shatter'd bone hath laid him groaning among the happier dead. It is an easy thing to rejoice in the tents of prosperity:. Thus could I sing and thus rejoice: but it is not so with me."

lifetimes,"You sit in silence. And the river answers. And I have loved you many, many years. I saw you standing by the wonderous river. And I have come today. To calm your fears. Those lifetimes. So many lifetimes. With you. The boatman singin' far across the water. What is this feelin' in my heart and soul. The nighttime angel spreads her wings around me. And I feel the sadness. And the river flows. Those lifetimes. So many lifetimes. With you. Listen to the music inside. That is all that you have to do. Listen to the music inside. Can't you hear what it says to you. And I shall get to know you. In these lifetimes. In awe and wonder. On down through the years. The nighttime angel spreads her wings around me. I feel the silence. And my doubts are cleared.

linden arden stole the highlights,"Linden Arden stole the highlights --. With one hand tied behind his back --. Loved the morning sun, and whiskey. Ran like water in his veins. Loved to go to church on Sunday. Even though he was a drinking man. When the boys came to San Francisco. They were looking for his life. But he found out where they were drinking. Met them face to face outside. Cleaved their heads off with a hatchet. Lord, he was a drinkin' man. And when someone tried to get above him. He just took the law into his own hands. Linden Arden stole the highlights. And they put his fingers through the glass. He had heard all those stories many, many times before. And he did not know nor care to ask. And he loved the little children like they were his very own. You say, ""Someday it may get lonely."". Now he's livin', livin' with a gun."

madam george,"Down on Cyprus Avenue. With a child-like vision leaping into view.. The clicking clacking of the high-heeled shoes,. Ford and Fitzroy; Madam George.. Marching with the soldierboy behind. He's much older now with hat on, drinking wine. And the smell of sweet perfume comes drifting thru. In the cool night breeze like Shalimar. And then your self control lets go. And suddenly you're up against the bathroom door.. The hallway lights are finely getting dim. You're in the front row touching him. And outside they're making all the stops. The kinds out in the streets collecting bottle tops,. Going for cigarettes and matches to the shops,. Happy talking, Madam George. And that's when you fall, Oh,. Oh, that's when you fall. And you fall into a trance. Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance. With your folded arms in history books you glance. Into the eyes of Madam George. And you think you've found your bag,. You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag. And in the corner playing dominoes in drag,. The one and only Madam George. And outside the frosty window raps. She says ""Be cool, I think that it's the cops"". Stands up, drops everything she gots,. It's not easy now you know. Now you know you gotta go. Catch a train from Dublin up to Sandy Row,. In the wind, rain & fog & slush & snow. Keep on going on. Say good-bye we know you're pretty far out. And all the little boys comin' round. They got gold cigarette lighters in their pockets. Walking away from it all, so cool.. That's when you fall.. Fade."

man has to struggle,"(Van Morrison). Man makes his money and they call him rich. Deep down inside he knows that life's still a bitch. Man tries to keep things but they're taken away. Man has to struggle all the live long day. Man has to sweat and toil his life filled with trouble. Man got to step and fetch it on the double. Man has to work so hard to make it all pay. Man has to struggle all the live long day. Man keeps on moving 'cos he can t keep still. Man has to set his goals and climb up the hill. Man sees the mountains and the deep blue sky. Man has to struggle till the day that he die. Well yes siree Bob them there's the breaks. That's how it is my friend don't make no mistake. Man has to take some action all of the time. Man by his nature's never satisfied. Man just can't vegetate no matter what they say. Man has to make it all the live long day. Man has to create karma that s the way that it is. Man has to keep on going way beyond his will. Man has to keep on being cos there s nothing else. And man just always has to go for himself. Take all the gurus when they meditate. Transcend the mundane into some altered state. You just might get there, but you'll have to pay. Man's got to struggle all the live tong day. Well yes siree now Bob them there's the breaks. That s how it is my friend don't make no mistake. Man has to watch the weather and the food that he eats. Man has to keep fit else he's prone to disease. No matter what he does there's stress every which way. Man has to struggle all the live long day. Man is in conflict with his natural self. Man has to suppress his own desires and instincts. Man has to work so hard to keep them at bay. Man has to struggle all the live long day. Man was told that he was born in original sin. By people long ago that were conning him. Man is so out of touch he can't trust himself. But man's still got to win by cunning and stealth."

meaning of loneliness,"Van Morrison. Exile Publishing Ltd / Universal Music Publishing Ltd. Lost in a strange city. Nowhere to turn. Far cry from the streets that. I came from. It can get lonely. When youâ€™re travelling hard. But you can even be lonely. Standing in your own back yard. Nobody knows the existential dread. Of the things that go on inside. Someone elseâ€™s head. Whether it be trivial. Or something that Dante said. But baby nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. No matter how well you know someone. You can only ever guess. How can you ever really know somebody else?. It takes more than a lifetime. Just to get to know yourself. Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. Instrumental break. I have to say a word about solitude. For the soul it sometimes they say can be good. And Iâ€™m partial to it myself, well I must confess. Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. Well thereâ€™s Sartre and Camus, Nietzsche and Hesse. If you dig deep enough. You gonna end up in distress. And no one escapes having to live life under duress. And no one escapes the meaning of loneliness. Well they say keep it simple when it gets to be a mess. And fame and fortune. Never brought anyone happiness. I must be lucky. Some of my friends think that Iâ€™m really blessed. Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. Scatting and instrumental break. No, no, no, no, nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. No, no, no, nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness. The published lyrics include the following verses:. Bright lights, big city nowhere to turn. Far cry from the streets where I was born. Iâ€™ve been doing some travelling. Sometimes the road gets hard. But you can also be lonely. Standing in your own backyard. No, no, no, no, no, no, nobody knows. The meaning of loneliness. No, no, no, no, nobody knows. The meaning of loneliness. Nobody knows the meaning of loneliness."

on hyndford street,"Take me back, take me way, way, way back. On Hyndford Street. Where you could feel the silence at half past eleven. On long summer nights. As the wireless played Radio Luxembourg. And the voices whispered across Beechie River. In the quietness as we sank into restful slumber in the silence. And carried on dreaming, in God. And walks up Cherry Valley from North Road Bridge, railway line. On sunny summer afternoons. Picking apples from the side of the tracks. That spilled over from the gardens of the houses on Cyprus Avenue. Watching the moth catcher working the floodlights in the evenings. And meeting down by the pylons. Playing round Mrs. Kelly's lamp. Going out to Holywood on the bus. And walking from the end of the lines to the seaside. Stopping at Fusco's for ice cream. In the days before rock `n' roll. Hyndford Street, Abetta Parade. Orangefield, St. Donard's Church. Sunday six bells, and in between the silence there was conversation. And laughter, and music and singing, and shivers up the back of the neck. And tuning in to Luxembourg late at night. And jazz and blues records during the day. Also Debussy on the third programme. Early mornings when contemplation was best. Going up the Castlereagh hills. And the cregagh glens in summer and coming back. To Hyndford Street, feeling wondrous and lit up inside. With a sense of everlasting life. And reading Mr. Jelly Roll and Big Bill Broonzy. And ""Really The Blues"" by ""Mezz"" Mezzrow. And ""Dharma Bums"" by Jack Kerouac. Over and over again. And voices echoing late at night over Beechie River. And it's always being now, and it's always being now. It's always now. Can you feel the silence?. On Hyndford Street where you could feel the silence. At half past eleven on long summer nights. As the wireless played Radio Luxembourg. And the voices whispered across Beechie River. And in the quietness we sank into restful slumber in silence. And carried on dreaming in God.."
once a day,"When you found somebody new I thought I never would. Forget you for I thought then that I never could. But time has taken all my pain away. Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day. Once a day, all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Is once a day, every day, all day long. And I'm so glad I'm not like a friend that I knew one time. He lost the one he loved and then he slowly lost his mind. Sat around and cried his life away. Lucky me I'm only hurtin' once a day. Once a day, all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Once a day, every day, all day long. Once a day, all day long. And once a night from dusk till dawn. The only time I wish that you weren't gone. Is once a day, every day, all day long. Once a day, every day, all day long. Once a day, every day, all day long"
once in a blue moon,Van Morrison. Exile Publishing Ltd / Universal Music Publishing Ltd. Once in a blue moon. Something good comes along. Once in a blue moon. Everything's not going wrong. When you get weary. Beating on the same old gong. Once in a blue moon. Someone like you comes along. Once every once in a while. Something comes along that feels just right. Once every once in a while. Just like switching on an electric light. And sometimes you try till youâ€™re blue in the face. But when you get that feeling. Nothing's going to take its place. Once in a blue moon. There's a thing called happiness. It happens when you're in. A state of natural grace. When the wind is blowing. All around the fence. I get that happy feeling. Things start making sense. All just feels so lucky. That you just can't go wrong. Once in a blue moon. Someone like you comes along. Once in a blue moon. There's a thing called happiness.

piper at the gates of dawn,"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. The coolness of the riverbank, and the whispering of the reeds. Daybreak is not so very far away. Enchanted and spellbound, in the silence they lingered. And rowed the boat as the light grew steadily strong. And the birds were silent, as they listened for the heavenly music. And the river played the song. The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. The song dream happened and the cloven hoofed piper. Played in that holy ground where they felt the awe and wonder. And they all were unafraid of the great god Pan. And the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. When the vision vanished they heard a choir of birds singing. In the heavenly silence between the trance and the reeds. And they stood upon the lawn and listened to the silence. Of the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn. It's the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn.

When it stops and it starts. It just tears me apart. Like a pain in my heart. But it's been misunderstood. Somebody's breaking the rules. And I'm nobody's fool. Well, well, well. She's my lady, she's my baby, she's my lady. She's my baby, she's my lady, she's my baby. She's my lady, now, now, now, now. When it's so high. I can reach for the sky. But when it's so low. I got nowhere to go. When it goes wrong. I just don't belong. When it goes right. It's clean out of sight. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm feeling so glad. I'm on top of the world. When I see you again. Well it's so true. I been thinking about you. Baby you're my flame. When it goes down. Down on the ground. When it goes down. But when it goes up. It just fills up my cup. When it goes up. Well, well, well. She's my lady, she's my baby, she's my lady. She's my baby, she's my lady, she's my baby. She's my lady, now, now, now, now."

song of being a child,"When the child was a child. It walked with arms hanging. Wanted the stream to be a river and the river a torrent. And this puddle, the sea. When the child was a child, it didn't know. It was a child. Everything for it was filled with life and all life was one. Saw the horizon without trying to reach it. Couldn't rush itself And think on command. Was often terribly bored. And couldn't wait. Passed up greeting the moments. And prayed only with it's lips. When the child was a child. It didn't have an opinion about a thing. Had no habits. Often sat crossed-legged, took off running. Had a cow lick in it's hair. And didn't put on a face when photographed. When the child was a child. It was the time of the following questions. Why am I me and why not you. Why am I here and why not there. Why did time begin and where does space end. Isn't what I see and hear and smell. Just the appearance of the world in front of the world. Isn't life under the sun just a dream. Does evil actually exist in people. Who really are evil. Why can't it be that I who am. Wasn't before I was. And that sometime I, the I, I am. No longer will be the I, I am. When the child was a child. It gagged on spinach, on peas, on rice pudding. And on steamed cauliflower. And now eats all of it and not just because it has to. When the child was a child. It woke up once in a strange bed. And now time and time again. Many people seem beautiful to it. And now not so many and now only if it's lucky. It had a precise picture of paradise. And now can only vaguely conceive of it at best. It couldn't imagine nothingness. And today shudders in the face of it. Go for the ball. Which today rolls between it's legs. With it's I'm here it came. Into the house which now is empty. When the child was a child. It played with enthusiasm. And now only with such former concentration. Where it's work is concerned. When the game, task, activity, subject happens to be it's work. When the child was a child. It was enough to live on apples and bread. And it's still that way. When the child was a child berries fell. Only like berries into it's hand. And still do. The fresh walnuts made it's tongue raw. And still do. Atop each mountain it craved. Yet a higher mountain. And in each city it craved. Yet a bigger city. And still does. Reach for the cherries in the treetop. As elated as it still is today. Was shy in front of strangers. And still is. It waited for the first snow. And still waits that way. When the child was a child. It waited restlessly each day for the return of the loved one. And still waits that way. When the child was a child. It hurled a stick like a lance into a tree. And it's still quivering there today. The child, the child was a child. Was a child, was a child, was a child, was a child. Child, child, child. When the child, when the child, when the child. When the child, when the child. The child, child, child, child, child. (added words by Van Morrison). And on and on and on and on, etc. And onward. With a sense of wonder. Upon the highest hill. Upon the highest hill. When the child was a child. Are you there. Shassas, shassas. Up on a highest hill. When the child was a child, was a child, was a child. Was a child, was a child, was a child, etc.. (fade to end)."

Gotta couple a bottles of wine, somethin' to turn you on. What-a you think of that? (think of that, girl). (Think of that girl). I said, ""Sit down cat, pull up a seat, you're soakin' wet"". ""Take off your coat and hat, wipe your feet on the mat"". In the back room (in the back room). In the back room (in the back room). I waited for you (waited for you). Ya waited for me (waited for me). I said, ""What time is it Charlie, where did we go all day?"". Seem to get nowhere and do nothin' but sit lookin' at each other. He said, ""I know, I been doin' the same thing for weeks"". I look at the clock and all of a sudden I'm hypnotized. It speaks to me, it goes ""tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock"", ah-huh The kid he said, ""I don't know what you guys do but I been workin'. so hard, lately that I can just only fall asleep in bed"". So he played some more sounds and grooved a while. Somebody brought out some cherry wine, cherry wine. And we talked about what was goin' on in the music world. And other things. Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha. The rain outside came down like it came never before. Down, came down, it came, rain rain rain. And I said, ""Baby what time is it, what time is it, tell me what time is it?. ""Ah, four-thirty"". So I peeked 'round the corner, the blind. An' there ya go, there's another girl that's comin' home from school. Lookin' so cool, just learned her A's to Z's. And said,. ""Hey man don't look funny, all the little girls comin' home from school. And they're sittin', talkin' and drinkin' and all them other funny things. A-ha-ha-ha. And Charlie said to me, ""Ya know what?"" I said, ""What?"". He said, ""Man you gotta go out there and do somethin' for yourself"". ""Feel like you wanna make it or else you gonna be sittin' 'round here like,. nothin' "". I said, ""You're right, I said ""You're so right"". He said, ""I know"" ha. I said, ""Do ya?"". Said, ""You know you're cuttin' records, cuttin' records right. You come through that"". An' just through all the time you're gonna be out on the road. I'm out on the backseat man, on the, on the highway. And the colors are gonna run. All of a sudden don't ya feel safe the next gig, you gotta make it. ""I said, ""Yeah I feel safe. I said, ""Yeah you know I can't stay here all the time as much as I'd like to. But, I just learned about all day and all night. And dig sounds, and go down to the river. And once the artists go through the motions. Gotta do my thing, aah-ah (in the back room) ah-ah. Gotta do my thing (in the back room). In the back room (in the back room). FADES-.

the ballad of jesse james,"Jesse James was a man. And he killed many men. He robbed the Glendale train. And he took from the richer. And he gave that to the poorer. He'd a hand and a heart and a brain. Oh Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life. Three children they were so brave. But that dirty little coward. That shot Mr. Howard. Has laid Jesse James in his grave. (Instrumental). On Wednesday night. When the moon was shining bright. They robbed that Glendale train. And the folks from miles about (yeah they can). They all said without a doubt. It was done by her Frankie and Jesse James (yes it was). Oh Jessie had a wife, to mourn for his life. Three children they were so brave. But that dirty little coward. That shot Mr. Howard. Has laid (poor) Jesse James in his grave. (Instrumental). Well the people held their breath. When they heard about Jesse's death (yeah). And they wondered how poor Jesse came to die (how did he die?). It was one of his guys, called Little Robert Ford. And he shot Jessie James on the sly. Oh Jessie had a wife to mourn for his life. Three children they were so brave. But that dirty little coward. That shot Mr. Howard. Has laid Jesse James in his grave. Has laid poor Jesse in his grave. He laid Jesse James in his grave."
the beauty of the days gone by,"(Van Morrison). When I recall just how it felt. When I went walking down by the take. My soul was free, my heart awake. When I walked down into the town. The mountain air was fresh and clear. The sun was up behind the hill. It felt so good to be alive. On that morning in spring. I want to sing this song for you. I want to lift your spirits high. And in my soul I want to feel. The beauty of the days gone by. The beauty of the days gone by. It brings a longing to my soul. To contemplate my own true self. And keep me young as I grow old. The beauty of the days gone by. The music that we used to play. So lift your glass and raise it high. To the beauty of the days gone by. I'll sing it from the mountain top. Down to the valley down below. Because my cup doth overflow. With the beauty of the days gone by. The mountain glen. Where we used to roam. The gardens there. By the railroad track. Oh my memory it does not lie. Of the beauty of the days gone by. The beauty of the days gone by. It brings a longing to my soul. To contemplate my own true self. And keep me young as I grow old. And keep me young as I grow old. And keep me young as I grow old. And keep me young as I grow old."

the great deception,"Did you ever hear about the great deception. Well the plastic revolutionaries take the money and run. Have you ever been down to love city. Where they rip you off with a smile. And it don't take a gun. Don't it hurt so bad in love city. Don't it make you not want to bother at all. And don't they look so self righteous. When they pin you up against the wall. Did you ever, ever see the people. With the tear drops in their eyes. I just can't stand it, stand it no how. Living in this world of lies. Did you ever hear about the rock and roll singers. Got three or four Cadillacs. Saying power to the people, dance to the music. Wants you to pat him on the back. Have you ever heard about the great Rembrandt. Have you ever heard about how he could paint. And he didn't have enough money for his brushes. And they thought it was rather quaint. But you know it's no use repeating. And you know it's no use to think about it. 'Cause when you stop to think about it. You don't need it. Have you ever heard about the great Hollywood motion picture actor. Who knew more than they did. And the newspapers didn't cover the story. Just decided to keep it hid.. Somebody started saying it was an inside job. Whatever happened to him?. Last time they saw him down on the Bow'ry. With his lip hanging off an old rusty bottle of gin. Have you ever heard about the so-called hippies. Down on the far side of the tracks. They take the eyeballs straight out of your head. Say son, kid, do you want your eyeballs back. Did you ever see the people. With the tear drops in their eyes. Just can't stand it no how. Living in this world of lies."

tir na nog,"We were standing in the kingdom. And by the mansion gate. We stood enraptured by the silence. As the birds sang their heavenly song. In Tir Na Nog. We stopped in the church of Ireland. And prayed to our father. And climbed up the mountainside. With fire in our hearts. And we walked all the way to Tir Na Nog. I said with my eyes that. I recognized your chin. It was my long lost friend. To help me from another lifetime. We took each others hands and cried. Like a river when we said hello. And we walked to Tir Na Nog. We made a big connection. On a golden autumn day. We were standing in the garden wet with rain. And our souls were young again. In Tir Na Nog. And outside the storm was raging. Outside Jerusalem. We drove in our chariots of fire. Following the big sun in the west. Going up, going up, to. Tir Na Nog. You came into my life. And you filled me and you filled me. Oh so joyous. By the clear cool crystal streams. Where the roads were quiet and still. And we walked all the way. To Tir Na Nog. How can we not be attached. After all we're only human. The only way then is to never come back. Except I wouldn't want that would you. If we weren't together again. In Tir Na Nog. We've been together before. In a different incarnation. And we loved each other then as well. And we sat down in contemplation. Many many many times you kissed mine eyes. In Tir Na Nog. ."

what makes the irish heart beat,"(Van Morrison). All that trouble all that grief. That's why I had to leave. Staying away too tong is in defeat. Why I'm singing this song. Why I'm heading back home. That's what makes the Irish heart beat. I'm just like a hobo riding a train. I'm like a gangster living in Spain. Have to watch my back and I'm running out of time. When I roll the dice again. If lady luck will call my name. That's what makes the Irish heart beat. Well that's what makes it beat. When I'm standing on the street. And I'm standing underneath this Wrigley's sign. Oh so far away from home. But I know I've got to roam. That's what makes the Irish heart beat. And it was off to foreign climes. On the Piccadilly line. We were standing underneath the Wrigley's sign. So far away from home. Well I know I've got to roam. That s what makes the Irish heart beat. Just like a sailor out on the foam. Any port in a storm. Where we tend to burn the candle at both ends. Down the corridors of fame. Like the spark ignites the flame. That's what makes the Irish heart beat. But I roll the dice again. If lady luck will call my name. That s what makes the Irish heart beat. Oh, that's what makes the Irish heart beat. That's what makes the Irish heart beat."

All the cards fell so many rounds. Down the road a piece Jack. I saw a bus coming and I had to get on it. I'm still trying to find my way back. Whatever happened to all those dreams a while ago. Whatever happened way across the sea. Whatever happened to the way it's supposed to happen. And whatever happened to me?.

when will i ever learn to live in god?,"The sun was setting over Avalon. The last time we stood in the west. Suffering long time angels enraptured by Blake. Burn out the dross innocence captured again. Standing on the beach at sunset all the boats. All the boats keep moving slow. In the glory of the flashing light in the evenings glow. When will I ever learn to live in God?. When will I ever learn?. He gives me everything I need and more. When will I ever learn?. You brought it to my attention everything that was made in God. Down through centuries of great writings and paintings. Everything lives in God. Seen through architecture of great cathedrals. Down through the history of time. Is and was in the beginning and evermore shall be. When will I ever learn to live in God?. When will I ever learn?. He gives me everything I need and more. When will I ever learn?. Whatever it takes to fulfill his mission. That is the way we must go. But you've got to do it your own way. Tear down the old, bring up the new. And up on the hillside its quiet. Where the shepherd is tending his sheep. And over the mountains and the valleys. The countryside is so green. Standing on the highest hill with a sense of wonder. You can see everything is made in God. Head back down the roadside and give thanks for it all. When will I ever learn to live in God?. When will I ever learn?. He gives me everything I need and more. When will I ever learn?."

With him your troubles you can share. If you live the life you love. You get the blessing from above. He heals the sick and heals the lame. Says you can do it too in Jesus name. He'll lift you up and turn you around. And put your feet back on higher ground. Reach out for him, he'll be there. With him your troubles you can share. You can use his higher power.

your mind is on vacation,"Sitting there yakkin' right in my face. Coming on like you own the place. If silence was golden. You couldn't raise a dime. Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime. You're quoting figures, you're dropping names. You're telling stories, you're playing games. You always laugh when things ain't funny. You try to sound like you don't need money. If talk was criminal, you'd lead a life of crime. Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime. You know that life is short and talk is cheap. Don't make promises that you can't keep. If you don't like the song I'm singing, just grin and bear it. All I can say is if the shoe fits wear it. If you must keep talking please can you make it rhyme. Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime. Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime. Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime."
