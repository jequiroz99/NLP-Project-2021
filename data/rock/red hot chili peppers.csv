Life could be a little sweet. But life could be a little shitty. What a pity. Boston and a Kansas City. Looking for a hundred. But you only ever found a fitty. Three fingers in the honeycomb. You ring just like a xylophone. Devoted to the chromosome. The day that you left home

On all you touched. But the burning flame. Turns to burning pain. Genuine genocide. And that's truly insane. So like a wild hurricane. I will dance on the grave. Of my race that died. When it should have been saved. American ghost dance...

Beside the only girl who really ever moved me. Happy days but sad I'm facin. Heaven knows that I'm on the case. How could I forget to mention the bicycle?. Somebody told the world. The beauty of your verse. My girl I heard it first. The beauty of your verse. A sticky finger and a wicked taste. Gotta a lot of love and a lyrical case. Be sure to write it in your book. I promise not to look. Wanna smell your sunny face. Funny place but it's never a waste. I'd hop this fence to make amends. I hope this movie never ends. How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention. Make it up makin you my business. A funny buttercup but I let her forgiveness. Happy days but sad I'm facin.

""But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea"". (dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit). Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes. When he told his sailor stories. She could feel the ocean foam rise.

She recognized. Because he gave her. A life of real love. It's no surprise. The nights are long. But the years are short. When you're alive. Way back when would never be again. It was a time. It's gonna catch you. So glad I met you. To walk the line. Like I said. You know I'm almost dead. You know I'm almost gone. And when the drummer drums. He's going to play my song. To carry me along.

And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool. He cries ""oh girl, you must be mad. What happened to the sweet love you and me had"". Against the door he leans and starts a scene. And his tears fall and burn the garden green. And so castles made of sand,. Fall in the sea eventually. A little indian brave who before he was ten.

And she wished and prayed she would stop living. So she decided to die. She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore. And to her legs she smiled. ""you won't hurt me no more"". But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say. ""look a golden winged ship is passing my way"". And it really didn't have to stop. It just kept on going. And so castles made of sand.

deep kick,"I started when we were little kids. Free spirits. but already tormented by our own hands. Given to us by our parents. We got together and wrote on desks. A slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains. A slipped through whatever cracks. We can find minds altered. We didn't falter in portraying hysterical. And tragic characters. In a smog filled universe. We loved the dirty city. And the journeys away. From it we had not yet been. Or seen our friends selves. Chase tails round and round in. Downward spiral leaving trail. Of irretrievable vital life juice. Behind still the brothers blood. Comrades partner family. Cuzz was impenetrable. And we lived inside it laughing. With no clother and everything. Experimental till death was upon us. In our face mortality. And lots of things seemed futile. Then but love and music can save us. And did while the giant grey monster grew. More poisoned and spewing ugly shit around. Nothing is the same so we keep moving.. Went off and off and got some hair cuts. Lookin wild and got all drugged up. Hopped a train into the night. Got a ride with a transvestite. Two boys in san francisco. Two boys in san francisco. Blasted off in a bart bathroom. Those coppers woke us up. Mothersfuckers woke us up. Two young brothers on a hover craft. Telepathetic love and bellylaughs. Storm the stage of universal. Slim shine talk boy go subversal. Papa's proud and so he sent us. Pounding hearts full and relentless. Two boys in london, england. Two boys in london, england. Climbing out of hostel windows. Wearing gear so out but in though. Come on kind and do the no no. Two young brothers on a hovercraft. Telepathics love and belly laughs. We went to fairfax high school. Jumped off buildings into their pools. We'd sit down and grease at canters. Run like hell they can't catch us. Two boys in l.a. proper. Two boys in l.a. proper. Stealin' anything that we could. Gotta sneak into the starwood. Gotta peak into the deep good. I remember 10 years ago. In hollywood we did some good. And we did some real bad stuff. But the butthole surfers. Always said it's better to regret. Something you did than something you didn't do. We were young and we were looking for the deep. Kick.... Seen 'em come seen 'em go"

dreams of a samurai,Standing naked in your kitchen. Feeling free that I could be alive. Clearly I'm a contradiction. Too young to be my wife. A peaceful storm is never hectic. Her mellow voice that I could be within. The uniform is anorexic. A jealous choice won't win. A metamorphosis samurai. Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a. Metamorphosis samurai. Paint your face cause I'm a black foot. I thought I counted up the fireflies. Close enough to get a good look. Time to mobilize. A metamorphosis samurai. Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a. Metamorphosis samurai. I'm a lonely lad. I've lost myself out on the range. I don't remember much. So don't ask me I've gone insane. Taking acid in a graveyard. Stealing food to keep the night alive. Every day I try to play hard. Even with my lies. The day they found you on a tour bus. The news was barren as a desert bone. The tabloids made a kind of small fuss. A couple pictures shown. I'm a lonely lad. I've lost myself out on the range. I don't remember much. So don't ask me I've gone insane. Slowly turning into driftwood. No one ever wants to die alone. Thinking that a pretty gift could. Make you less unknown. Dirty sneakers on the pavement. The brilliant features of a common man. See the miracle of your life. No one ever can. I'm a lonely lad. I've lost myself out on the range. I don't remember much. So don't ask me I've gone insane. See the world go by. The changes that we entertain. I don't recall it all. Remember I have gone insane

goodbye angels,"Suicide a month before I met you. Deep regrets, I never could forget you. Somehow you made your way to my decade. Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl. In the sun, I see you with your guard down. Number one, you're moving to a hard town. Do not dismiss the promise that you made me. Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time. Overkill you took another red pill. On the sheet is everything that you spilled. We are the ones you want to know right now. Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light. Come again to murder your report card. Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard. You are the one I want to be stuck with. Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight. Favor some. Way too young. Slave to none. Way too young. Say goodbye my love. I can see it in your soul. Say goodbye my love. Thought that I could make you whole. Let your lover sail. Death was made to fail. Sticky fingers find the way to take her. Crumple up another piece of paper. I know your days are numbered when it comes to. Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life. Slip away into the solar system. Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them. Some like it dark and now I know where to. Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you. Serpentine, I think she was an aussie. Bloody hell, a common kamikaze. Give up the ghost before you go under. Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder. Kicking hard and looking for a rescue. Watch me starve was never to impress you. I would have killed the part of me to have you. Ayo ayo ayo ayo story. Say goodbye my love. I can see it in your soul. Say goodbye my love. Thought that I could make you whole. Let your lover sail. Death was made to fail. Babe I know love is a funny thing. Born to die in the eternal spring. Your flickering is more than just a small flame. Welcome to the party, it's a ball game. Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with. Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat. Suicide is never going to save you. When I cried, it was because I came too. You are the one I want to know right now. Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this"
goodbye hooray,"Junior pimp at the old café. Got to chase those girls around. Westbound, drunk with lots to say. But he never makes a sound. Hustlers get what they deserve. But it's always half the gate. Good things come to those who wait. Like an expiration date. See you around I'll see you around. I'll play all night. Can't get uptight. I'll lead all your mind games astray. See you around I'll see you around. I'll play all night. Can't get uptight. See you, so long, goodbye, hooray. Curb you tongue oh scallywag. Because you've got no flag to wave. Save your breath for the black and white. Every dog will have his day"

green heaven,"About this planet, there is something I know. There's a very big difference between above and below. A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor. Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow. Here, above land, man has laid his plan. And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan. We got a government so twisted and bent. Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent. We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution. Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution. Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution. If you think you're just away,. you're in a mental institution. And that's a heart felt shame. 'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same. So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?. Time now to take you to a different place. Where peace lovin' whales. flow through liquid outer space. A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace. A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace. Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none. 'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun. No one tells 'em how their life is run. And no one points at them with a gun. They have a lot of love for every living creature. The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature. They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher. Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you. Back to the land of the police man. Where he does whatever he says he can. Including hating you because you're a Jew. Or beating black ass, that's nothing new. Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl. They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all. They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails. Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail. So support your police, support your local wars. That's the way to open economic doors. Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore. We assume the position to sell the ammunition. What the fuck? It's the american tradition. Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen. Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?"
halo,"I'm the man, i'm the king. I'm the one thats pure inside. Everyday, everyway. I smell of suicide. Bitter sins how they grow within. So you tell me it ain't right. I am all sins and you're my reason for life. I will stone you, stone you. Wrap my arms around you. I will stone you, stone you. My little halo. I'm the man, i'm the king. I'm the one that's broken from giving. Everday, everyway. I swear just one last try. Killing me with the death to be. Something that's so right. I am all sins, my hands are scarred with time. I will stone you, stone you. Wrap my arms around you. I will stone you, stone you. My little halo. I'm the man with the rock in his hand,got. The rock in my hand gonna stone you stone you"
hanalei,"Feeling good and I don't know why. Another day and another high. I walk around like I am on the ray. Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei. I met a girl and I liked her vibe. Another day and another ride. I met a girl who wants to save the world. Make it safe. For someone else to find their faith. I'm away I'm away Hanalei. A simple song and it made me cry. I really don't want to pass me by. A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway. The revolution in your blood. Creates the wave. I picked her up on the road to surf. Looked a lot like a mother earth. She said hello my name. Is Charlotte Gray, hey. Make it safe. For someone else to find their faith. You and I do more than merely survive"

hometown gypsy,Drivin? up the coast. To find a version of the truth. Left the backdoor swinging. Like a dirty little sleuth. The truth is I have never. Felt half this alive. Now it?s time to dance. Upon the grave called 45. Jacked up on some Kerouac. And surely bullet proof. The girl who taught me what to do. Was missing her front tooth. Gentle as a storm. Inside your mental health. I wanna find the answer. But I just can?t find myself. I say so long. To the way I played. The way I played. Inside of yesterday. Hey let?s run around. The great escape. From out of my hometown. Later I would look for love. Inside a woman?s dorm. A couch to keep me humble. And her breath to keep me warm. Ophelia was the girl. That I was feeling for. Come to realize. It was me who was the whore. A captain lost himself. Inside a 40 year old skull. The drink of choice was knowledge. And we always wanted more. Drunken sailors. Seeking their Geronimo. Instead they found the things. That they really didn?t wanna know. I say so long. To the way I played. The way I played. Inside of yesterday. Hey let?s run around. The great escape. From out of my hometown. Country roads. Would never let me stay. The way I played. Inside of yesterday. A devil?s growl and cat?s meow. Were blended into one. Termites called suburbanites. Were eating all the fun. A juggernaut of comedy. And blasphemy. I wanna stop the madness. But I think it has to be. I say so long. To the way I played. The way I played. Inside of yesterday. Hey let?s run around. The great escape. From out of my hometown. (Added to final song). Country roads. Would never let me stay. The way I played. Inside of yesterday. Hey let?s run around. The great escape. From out of my hometown

Work and play all day until the sun is high. Haley and the comets sang an old rock jam. The ukulele play another song I'll brag. (Chorus). God save us all and tell us how it ends. Laugh til' we fall. So why can't we be friends?. Stole a lot from Peter. Cause you had to pay your Paul. And when you find that's not enough. He'll break your fall.. Some get on and some get off the carousel. I think it's time to go, so I will fare thee well.. (Chorus). God save us all and tell us how it ends. Laugh til' we fall. So why can't we be friends?. Stole a lot from Peter.

Into the apple orchard by the school. We could make a little residue. We could find a place to stay. A secret little hideway. Spend a little time inside of you. All I do, all I do. All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on you. All I do, all I do, all I do, all I do"

melancholy mechanics,"Persistant mystic faults my vision. It's like always this point of collision. It's raining in my cranium. My head feels like a stadium. Three pound of love. About to burst.

Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000. Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most. as the uncontrollable soldiers. Of suffering succotash. Instantaneous infiltration. leaves me with a case of bustation,. Frustration,. Alone in the constellation of alienation. detached from empty conversation. I wait. I wait. For the wave to break"

Talking about my thoughts 'cause they must grow. Cock my brain to shoot my load. I'm on my porch 'cause I lost my house key. Pick up my book I read Bukowski. Can I get another kiss from you. Kiss me right here on my tattoo. Good God, where's my sleigh now. Good God, playing for days now. Good God, any day now. Good God, take me away now. Good God, De Niro's insane now.

Listen to the talking heart in my chest. With this gift good Lord I am blessed. There's a lump and it's in my throat. I'm in love with the wilderness. Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way. In the waterfall I just wanna play. Naked in the rain. Doctor Doolittle what's your secret. Give it to me doctor. Don't keep it. Naked in the rain. Doctor Doolittle what's your secret.

The head that's getting pregnant lives. to give and give. What was I thinking in my head. The color red. Breaking hearts instead of bread. Something I said. Checkmated by frustration. Need to be cut loose. A different kind of being lost. A sullen cost. Picaboo street in Timbuktu. Do I need repeat. That a boy named Sue ?. Rockin' to the beat. Of the kangaroo. Let me kiss your feet. And your forehead too.

And I'm in it come and get it. If a chase it I might waste it. Come and get it. I might waste it. Come and get it. Am I all alone. Sitting in the fire. Get along and have some fun. Floating to be higher. Maybe I'm your special one. Silent testifier. Breathe the moon. And eat the sun. Sitting in the fire. A tiny wink is all. All we have. No it's not much more. But don't get mad. Am I all alone. Three lbs. of love. Inside my skull. A million more lives. It's never drill. Just a few times spun. Spun around the sun. A couple more or less. And then we're done.
open/close,"So we were down in Brazil and. And that place is wild, we were in Rio de Janeiro. And we had this sort of a security guard, tough guy. And he was supposed to take us around. I said hey could, you know, could you take us to the?. The favelas and show us the prostitution. And the drug deals and the night fights and. You know, the street life of your town. He said: ""sure"" so we, we pull up to this hooker and. She's wearing this kind of a bright green mini skirt. And it turns out it's a transexual. I said: ""get over here"" and she comes over. And she thinks she's busted. But she's not busted, no she's not busted. We just wanted to smack her in the ass a few times. I say, hey what's up girl?. Chorus. I get out of bed. And I clear up my head. I don't want to go. But I do it instead. We are dreams. Within a dream. I get into bed. And I turn off my head. I started to float. Was it something she said. We are dreams. Within a dream. ? So I remember we got our driver's license. And my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green and in?. Hollywood we get so crazy in the winter. The rains would come and the hills. Would just kind of melt down into the city lights and. Well you know we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills. And we'd listen to progressive rock music. And just kind of trip out and. Well we were dreaming, you know, we were dreaming. And we were talking about what we wanted to do. And we were talking about girls and music and?. You know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star. I didn't even know what that was and I was like. ""whatever you want to do man. I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend"". Chorus. I get out of bed. And I clear up my head. I don't want to go. But I do it instead. We are dreams. Within a dream. I get into bed. And I turn off my head. I started to float. Was it something she said. We are dreams. Within a dream. Why in the world would you want it to be. Why would you wanna take it so, so little really. All this things that come down from the sky. Raining upon your head. Make me stop and wonder why. Can I just spell it out, make it clear. Make it easy to read. For the simple man like me?. I don't think so. I reached out to my family and I said. ""It's not about religion and the god. Sitting in the chair in the sky. With a punishing hand"", no. It's about heaven in your heart. Now, when can we start?. I wanna choose love instead of fear. Won't you come right now over here. And we come now. Let me make it easy this time. I love you"

He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat. And between his legs was a sweat young lass. He threw a hundred women up against the wall. And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all. By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop. Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone. Last night and the night before,. I heard a fop outside,. then I came in doors. Freak out!. Now that I told you a little something about the flea. A little something about the tree,. A little something about me. I can't leave you hangin' but my man shermzy,. He swings the yang, he bangs the yang. And now, it's time to hear him do his playin',. You better be burning sherman!. We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way.

Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip. Calling up a little girl with a bull whip. Lickity split go snap ""snap"". Girl gettin' off all in my lap. The tallest tree the sweetest sap. Blowin' my ass right of the map. Ooo and it's nice out here. I think I'll stay for a while"

Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off. Paid off. God knows when but you're doin' it again!. You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend. The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen. Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten. So look out kid. Look out, kid. Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid. Look out, kid, because they keep all hid. Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot. Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but. The phone's tapped anyway, maggie says that many say. They must bust in early May. Orders from the D.A.. Walkin' on your tip toes, don't try no doze. Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose. Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes. Cause we don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows. Look out, kid. Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid. Look out, kid, because they keep all hid. Looks to me like you did. A little to much hittin' kid. You should've took it to the bridge. Before you started to skid, kid. Look out, kid. The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan. Chillin' em, thrillin' em, and red hot killin' em. Killin' em. I said killin' em. Get sick, get well, hand around an ink well. Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell. Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille. Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail. But users, cheaters, six time losers. Hand around the theatres. Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool. Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters. Look out, kid. Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid. Look out, kid, because they keep all hid. Look out, kid. Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid. Look out, kid, because they keep all hid."

taste the pain,Flat on my back. In a lonely sprawl. I stare at the ceiling. 'cause I can not fall. Asleep tonight no not at all. Head lights flash. Across my bedroom wall. Crying eyes open. 'cause I can not fall. In love with you. No not at all. Chrous. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. Busted in two. Like a brittle stick. I could not drink Because my throat constricts. Lovesick from you. That will never do. Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound. I could not scream. No. I could not shout. It out to you. Nothing to do. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. This may come as a shocking surprise. I have to take a walk. I have to kiss it goodbye. Goodbye my love. Goodbye my love. I am not alive. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. Walk away and taste the pain. Come again some other day. Aren't you glad you weren't afraid. Funny how the price gets paid. Funny how the price gets paid
tear,"This is my time. This is my tear. I can see clearly now. That this is not a place. For playing solitaire. Tell me where you want me. This is my time. This is my tear. Comin' on strong. Baudelaire. Seems to me like. All the world gets high. When you take a dare. Let it rise before you. This is my crime. [Chorus:]. All in all I'm. Loving every rise and fall. The sun will make and I will take. Breath to be sure of this. In the end, and then. All will be forgiven when. Surrender rises high and I. Gave what I came to give. Say it now because you never know. oh never know. Devil may cry devil may care. Distiller's got a scream. And now I know just why. When she's movin' air. Can you feel the voltage. This is my time. California skies. Got room to spare. This is my time. [Chorus]. Take it outside. Take it out there. Seems to me like. All the world gets high. When you take a dare. In the final moment. This is my time. [Chorus]"
tearjerker,My mouth fell open. Hoping that the truth. Would not be true. Refuse the news. I'm feeling sick now. What the fuck am I supposed to do. Just lose and lose. First time I saw you. You were sitting. Backstage in a dress. A perfect mess. You never knew this. But I wanted badly for you to. Requite my love. Chorus :. Left on the floor. Leaving your body. When highs are the lows. And lows are the way. So hard to stay. Guess now you know. I love you so. I liked your whiskers. And I liked the dimple in your chin. Your pale blue eyes. You painted pictures. Cause the one. Who hurts. Can give so much. You gave me such. C horus. Left on the floor. Leaving your body. When highs are the lows. And lows are the way. So hard to stay. Guess now you know. I love you so
teenager in love,Each time we have a quarrel. It almost breaks my heart. 'Cos I am so afraid. That we will have to part. Each night I ask the stars up above. Why must I be a teenager in love.

tell me baby,They come from every state to find. Some dreams were meant to be declined. Tell the man what did you have in mind. What have you come to do. No turning water into wine. No learning while you're in the line. I'll take you to the broken sign. You see the lights are blue. Come and get it. Lost it at the city limit. Say goodbye. 'Cause they will find a way to trim it. Everybody. Lookin' for a silly gimmick. Gotta get away. Can't take it for another minute. This town is made of many things. Just look at what the current brings. So high it's only promising. This place was made on you. Tell me baby what's your story. Where you come from. And where you wanna go this time on. Tell me lover are you lonely. The thing we need is. Never all that hard to find out. Tell me baby what's your story. Where do you come from. And where you wanna go this time on. You're so lovely are you lonely. Of giving up on the innocence you left behind. Some claim to have the fortitude. Too shrewd to blow the interlude. Sustaining pain to set a mood. Step out to be renewed. I'll move you like a baritone. Jungle Brothers on the microphone. Getting over with the undertone. It's time to torn to stone. Chitty chitty baby. When your nose is in the nitty gritty. Life could be a little sweet. But life could be a little shitty. What a pity. Boston and a Kansas City. Looking for a hundred. But you only ever found a fitty. Three fingers in the honeycomb. You ring just like a xylophone. Devoted to the chromosome. The day that you left home

Would you believe that I'm tellin' a lie?. Would you believe that I cut you out?. I couldn't tear myself of hatred. From the loaded masses. It's all it's all a game, your crazy bastard.

the hunter,Woke up this morning like I always do. I still like to think that I'm new. Time just gets its way. Strawberries left to decay. Can't find my pants or my bank account. Don't you slip away. Voices that start to betray. Even though you raised me I will never be your father. King of each and every sunset marquis. Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother. You're my old man in the sea. I still like to laugh when I make a joke. I still like to think that there's hope. Time just has its say. Strawberries left to decay. Struck by the sight of an empty hall. Don't you fade away. Voices that start to betray. Even though you raised me I will never be your father. King of each and every sunset marquis. Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother. You're my old man in the sea. The hunter gets hunted. We all get confronted. Don't just slip away. Voices that start to betray.

From the seat of my car. Two centipedes stuck. In one glass jar. The longest wave. Waiting on the wind. To tell my side. What you want?. What you need?. Do you love?. Maybe I'm the right one. Maybe I'm the wrong. Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon. Time to call it a day. Maybe you're my last love. Maybe you're my first. Just another way to play inside the universe. Now I know why we came. Sterile as the barrel. Of an old 12 gauge. Under my skin. And half my age. Hotter than the wax. On a saxifrage. The longest wave. Waiting on the wind. To turn my page. Steady your sails. For the butterfly flap. Whatever you do. Don't close that gap. I'm dreaming of a woman. But she's just my nap. Your ship is in. Waiting on the tide so I can swim. What you want. What you need. Do you love. Maybe I'm the right one. Maybe I'm the wrong. Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon. Time to call it a day. Maybe you're my last love. Maybe you're my first. Just another way to play inside the universe. Now I know why we came. Now I know why we came. Now I know"

From the bible belt. Dealing with the hand. That I've been dealt. Sitting in the grip. Of a killing fist. Giving up blood. Just to exist. Rub me wrong. And I get pissed. No I cannot. Get to this.

we turn red,"We got large and we got small, we got a swimming pool and a cannon ball. We turn red and we turn green, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic. Who knew it's so damn drastic. Show me what it is you believe in. Slowly she sinks all your teeth in. Do you want to go fishing in new orleans. Do you want to get up early in the morning. Take me to the river where we do the little storming. Hallelujah, I feel it warming. Sitting here I count the moons. The orders we obeyed. Every night 'fore we go to bed. I watch while the others pray. Send it off through delaware just. Make it fair for the legionnaires. Paint a simple portrait of my kind. Permission to the heartless bombs. Gold plated hate and the waitress moms. Serving up the stories of my mind. Mexico you are my neighbor. Home of the let's be braver. Give me all your sick and your tired. Races that we admire. Do you want to go dancing in chicago. Trinidad's got it bad for tobago. Take me to the lake where we do the avocado. Hallelujah, a desparado. Sitting here I count the moons. The orders we obeyed. Every night 'fore we go to bed. I watch while the others pray. Send it off through delaware just. Make it fair for the legionnaires. Paint a simple portrait of my kind. Permission to the heartless bombs. Gold plated hate and the waitress moms. Serving up the stories of my mind. Coming down from the deserts where you. Caught a glimpse of the billionaire. Tell me I'm the right one for the ride. Paper signs out on the lawns. Gold minds and the priceless pawns. Does your canyon really open wide. We got large and we got small, we got a swimming pool and a cannon ball. We turn red and we turn green, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen"
wet sand,My shadow side so amplified. Keeps coming back dissatisfied. Elementary son but it's so...... My love affair with everywhere. Was innocent why do you care. Someone start the car. Time to go...you're the best I know. My sunny side has up and died. I'm betting that when we collide. The universe will shift into a low. The travesties that we have seen. Are treating me like Benzedrine. Automatic laughter from a pro. My what a good day. For a walk outside. I like to get to know. You a little better baby. God knows that I really tried. My what a good day. For a take out bride. I'd like to say we. Did it for the better of. I saw you there so unaware. Those hummingbirds all in your hair. Elementary son but it's so. The disrepair of Norma Jean. Could not compare to your routine. Balarama beauty. Going toe to toe. My what a good day. Just to let it slide. I'd like to say we did it for the better of. I thought about it. And I brought it out. I'm motivated by the lack of doubt. I'm consecrated but I'm not devout. The mother the father the daughter. Right on the verge just one more dose. I'm travelling from coast to coast. My theory isn't perfect but it's close. I'm almost there why should I care. My heart is hurting when I share. Someone open up and. Let it show. My what a good day. For a walk outside. I'd like to think we did it for the better of. I thought about it. And I brought it out. I'm motivated by the lack of doubt. I'm consecrated but I'm not devout. The mother the father the daughter. You don't form in the wet sand. You don't form at all. You don't form in the wet sand. I do Yeah. You don't form in the wet sand. You don't form at all. You don't form in the wet sand. I do

what it is,"Give it up to this time full of strife. Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life. Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight. At the never ending ocean of perfect insights. 'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light. The animated aura will give delight. Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight. With the power of It, we are about to astound. All your preconceptions, they will come unbound. ""Listen very close,"" my inner voice expounds. ""We are the human race, and we groove to the sound"". Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth. A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth. People have to know that it's not about money. Cash is not the way to make your life sunny. There is no need if you got the soul seed. Love, life and peace, it can only begin. When you know in your heart that the change is within. Love all your brothers and love all your sisters. Love all the missus and love all the misses. And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses. Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses. What it is, what it is, so much to be found. What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds. What it is, what it is, what it is in a song. What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong. Balance your life with the right kind of foods. To eat a sad cow is to eat another you. Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude. It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods. Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes. 'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude. And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you. So please y'all, take some sound advice. Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice. The always sober you is especialy nice. Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot. I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute. Refuse to fight wars for political whores. Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores. It is my notion that the perfect peace potion. Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean. The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean. Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion. There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures. The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature. We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher. ""Good morning class, how very nice to meet you"". What it is, what it is, so much to be found. What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds. What it is, what it is, what it is in a song. What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong. Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars. With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars. You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid. Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid. But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid. Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix. These cool brothers make the world go 'round. Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound. But, by all these men, it was found. Each and every person can be just as renowned. Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown. Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down. Go spread the word from town to town. We are the human race and we groove to the sounds. Now that you've heard what it is in a song."
