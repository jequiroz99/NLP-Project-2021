how can i go on,How can I go on?. How can I go on this way.... When all the salt is taken from the sea. I stand dethroned. I'm naked and I bleed. But when your finger points so savagely. Is anybody there to believe in me?. To hear my plea and take care of me?. How can I go on. From day to day. Who can make me strong in every way. Where can I be safe. Where can I belong. In this great big world of sadness. How can I forget. Those beautiful dreams that we shared. They're lost and they're no where to be found. How can I go on?. Sometimes I start to tremble in the dark. I cannot see. When people frighten me. I try to hide myself so far from the crowd. Is anybody there to comfort me. Precious Lord... Hear my plea and take care of me. How can I go on. From day to day. Who can make me strong in every way. Where can I be safe. Where can I belong. In this great big world of sadness. How can I forget. Those beautiful dreams that we shared. They're lost and no where to be found. How can I go on?

back to the light,"Far, far from the light. Here the night creatures call. In the cold breath they howl. And the hollow tears, they're calling you. I'll be there, though maybe you wont see my babe.

I'm holding on, believe it. We'll be walking in the light. 'Cos there'll be no place left to hide. Back to the light. Back to the dreams that are paved with gold. Back to the light.

body count,"(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe). . All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone. Never dared to take a chance. Goin' home alone. But it gets so fucky cold. When it's late at night. Leave the foxholes on their own. Do you sleep well at night?. Body count, feeling hot. Body count, keeping warm. Friends are playing with danger. They don't know where it's found. With their casual letters. It's just another chain. You've lost the innocence. That you've never found. Standing in the DMZ. Don't get turned around. (chorus). Body count, feeling hot.

I saw the ceiling falling down your way. When they looked at you, you could turn away. You didn't bother then by the light of day, you'll stay. But at night, I hear your call. Late at night, I hear your call. You said that you could turn away. I knew that you going to stay. The walls are falling all around. They pinned you down onto the ground. But at night, I hear your call"

drowse,"Words and music by Roger Taylor. It's the sad eyed goodbye. Yesterday's moments I remember. It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall. It's the mistier mists the hazier days. The brighter sun and the easier lays. There's all the more reason for laughing and crying. When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all. It's the fantastic drowse. Of the afternoon Sundays. That bored you to rages of tears. The unending pleadings. To waste all your good times. In thoughts of your middle-aged years. It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told. For the everyday hero it all turns to zero. And there's all the more reason. For living or dying when you're young. And your troubles are all very small. Out here on the street we'd gather and meet. And scuff up the sidewalk. With endlessly restless feet. Half on the time we'd broaden our minds. More in the pool hall. Than we did in the school hall. With the down town chewing gum bums. Watching the night life the lights and the fun. Never wanted to be the boy next door. Always thought I'd be something more. But it ain't easy for a small town boy. It ain't easy at all. Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong. It's easier from an arm chair. Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness. Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess. I think I'll be Clint Eastwood. Jimi Hendrix he was good. Let's try William the Conqueror"
earth,Words and music by Tim Staffell. I might be at a table. And suddenly I'll catch. A fleeting vision of her crystal seas. Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway. Underneath the sun I've never seen. 'Cos I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. I might be chasing waves of light. Out towards the rim. Where stars are sparse. And the cold of space seeps in. But I might be in a bar room. Drinking methylated gin. And thinking of the places I have been. Yes I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. Cast adrift amongst the stars. I float from sun to sun. Dreaming of the world that gave me birth. All the places I have been. Remind me there is none. To match the green living hills of earth. 'Cos I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth
flick of the wrist,Words and music by Freddie Mercury. Dislocate your spine if you don't sign. He says I'll have you seeing double. Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied. Simply with those eyes ooh.

going back,Words and music by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. I think I'm going back. To the things I learnt so well in my youth. I think I'm returning to. Those days when I was young enough to know the truth. Now there are no games. To only pass the time. No more colouring books. No Christmas bells to chime. But thinking young and growing older is no sin. And I can't play the game of life to win. I can recall a time. When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend. And now I think I've got. A lot more than just my toys to lend. Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide. And every day can be. My magic carpet ride. And I can play hide and seek with my fears. And live my days instead of counting my years. Then everyone debates. The true reality. I'd rather see the world. The way it used to be. A little bit of freedom's all we lack. So catch me if you can

My wife and I our needs and nothing more. All my friends by a year by and by disappeared. But we're safe enough behind our door. I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew. The work devoured my waking hours but when my time. was through. Reward of all my efforts. My own Limited Company. I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company.

Take care of those you call your own

And I'm waiting for the tide to turn me on. To the flower that is beckoning me on. And I'm ready. I know I'm going away. Nothing you can do to stop me. Myself a license up to heaven. I'm going again.

Soles of my feet are expanding due to heat 'cos I. I'm losing sense of rhythm. Losing sense of rhythm. I'm completely changing to a brand new system

hijack my heart,Words and music by Queen. Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day. Just minding my business thinking my thoughts. Nothing much to say. When suddenly I got hit. Imagine my suprise. Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes. I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile. I'd never seen anything that came within miles. My heart got hijacked by you. Stuck in the traffic. Stuck at the lights what do I see. Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me. She takes off. Imagine my disgust. Like a bat out of hell. I get to eat her dust. I never had known anything to compare with her laugh. I'd never known anything that counted by half. My heart got hijacked by you. Hijack my heart. Hijack my heart. Steals my heart. Hijack my heart. Hijack my heart. Look at the cities. Look at the streets what do you see. Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be. Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose. It comes out of nowhere. Right out of the blue. I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile. I'd never seen anything that came within miles. My heart got hijacked by you. Hijack my heart. Now you really got a hold on me. You hijacked my heart. Don't you know you won't let me be. Stole my heart. Threw away the key. Oooee baby what's become of me. You hijacked my heart. Now you really got a hold on me. Hijack my heart

Is anybody there to believe in me?. To hear my plea and take care of me?. How can I go on. From day to day. Who can make me strong in every way. Where can I be safe. Where can I belong. In this great big world of sadness. How can I forget. Those beautiful dreams that we shared. They're lost and they're no where to be found. How can I go on?. Sometimes I start to tremble in the dark. I cannot see. When people frighten me. I try to hide myself so far from the crowd. Is anybody there to comfort me. Precious Lord... Hear my plea and take care of me. How can I go on. From day to day. Who can make me strong in every way. Where can I be safe. Where can I belong. In this great big world of sadness. How can I forget. Those beautiful dreams that we shared. They're lost and no where to be found. How can I go on?

But even to the end of his life. He'll bring a little love. Ah ah ah ah ah. I reign with my left hand I rule with my right. I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night.

To hell with all of you hand in hand. But now it's time to be gone. La la la la forever forever. Ah ah ah ah ah

my fairy king,Words and music by Freddie Mercury. In the land where horses born with eagle wings. And honey bees have lost their stings. There's singing forever. Lions den with fallow deer. And rivers made from wines so clear. Flow on and on forever. Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air. And baby lambs where Samson dares. To go on on on on on on. My fairy king can see things. He rules the air and turns the tides. That are not there for you and me. Ooh yeah he guides the winds. My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong. Then came man to savage in the night. To run like thieves and to kill like knives. To take away the power from the magic hand. To bring about the ruin of the promised land. They turn the milk into sour. Like the blue in the blood of my veins. Why can't you see it. Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming rain. Son of heaven set me free and let me go. Sea turn dry no salt from sand. Seasons fly no helping hand. Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes. Someone someone just drained the colour from my wings. Broken my fairy circle ring. And shamed the king in all his pride. Changed the wings and wronged the tides. Mother mercury mercury. Look what they've done to me. I cannot run. I cannot hide

polar bear,"Words and music by Brian May and Tim Staffell. In the bright shop window sits the polar bear. Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there. Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile. To see him as you'd see a star. Love him from where you are. He's not for, not for, not for sale. Past an open window walks the pretty girl. Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell. But if I ask her she might turn her smile away. To see her as I'd see a star. Love her from where you are. She's not for, not for, not for sale. I guess I'll learn to look. Without a grasping hand. Minor contentment wears a smile. I love her from where I lie. He's not for,not for,not for sale"

To yourself be true. I am a man of God. I should not be here with you. Free me we are mortal, ah. Come a little closer to the fire. To love and live that one desire. Denial of that love is treason.

Victims of our weaknesses and passion. (I am falling, I am falling we, we are mortal). Why do I believe in you. You're destroying my world. Hold nothing back. Give me all there is. I want it all.

He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of, as the master of his. fate. The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognise. Material ambition that her gentleness disguised.

The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul. That slowly take control. I love you for your passion, I love you for your fire. The violent desire that burns me in its flame. A love I dare not name. His rise was irresistible (yeah) - he grew into the part. His explanation simply that he suffered for his art. No base considerations of some glittering reward.

That's not far to bend

there must be more to life than this,"There must be more to life than this. There must be more to life than this. How do we cope in a world without love. Mending all those broken hearts. And tending to those crying faces. There must be more to life than living. A better way for us to survive. Why should it be just a case of black or white. There must be more to life than this. Why is this world so full of hate. People dying everywhere. And we destroy what we create. People fighting for their human rights. But we just go on saying c'est la vie. So this is life. There must be more to life than killing. A better way for us to survive. What good is life, in the end we all must die. There must be more to life than this. There must be more to life than this. There must be more than meets the eye. I live and hope for a world filled with love. Then we can all just live in peace. There must be more to life, much more to life. There must be more to life, more to life than this."
these are the days of our lives,Sometimes I get to feelin'. I was back in the old days - long ago. When we were kids when we were young. Thing seemed so perfect - you know. The days were endless we were crazy we were young. The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know. The rest of my life's been just a show. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is true. When I look and I find I still love you. You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide. Ain't that a shame. I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride. When life was just a game. No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did. When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know. Better sit back and go with the flow. Cos these are the days of our lives. They've flown in the swiftness of time. These days are all gone now but some things remain. When I look and I find no change. Those were the days of our lives - yeah. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true. When I look and I find. I still love you. I still love you

We all must plan our hopes together. Or we'll have no more future at all. Time waits for nobody. You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong. You know what's going on.

was it all worth it,Words and music by Queen. What is there left for me to do in this life. Did I achieve what I had set in my sights. Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand. Was it all worth it was it all worth it. Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it. We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet. Played the circuit thought we were perfect. Was it all worth it. Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night. Was it all worth it. Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life. Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years. Put down our money without counting the cost. It didn't matter if we won if we lost. Yes we were vicious yes we could kill. Yes we were hungry yes we were brill. We served a purpose like a bloody circus. We were so dandy we love you madly. Was it all worth it. Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life. Was it all worth it was it all worth it.

white queen,Words and music by Brian May. So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes. So sad her eyes as it began. On such a breathless night as this. Upon my brow the lightest kiss. I walked alone. And all around the air did sway. My lady soon will stir this way. In sorrow known. The white queen walks. And the night grows pale. Stars of lovingness in her hair. Heeding unheard pleading one word. So sad my eyes she cannot see. How did thee fare what have thee seen. The mother of the willow green. I call her name. And 'neath her window have I stayed. I loved the footsteps that she made. And when she came. White queen how my heart did ache. And dry my lips no word would make. So still I wait. My goddess hear my darkest fear. I speak too late. It's for evermore that I wait. Dear friend goodbye. No tears in my eyes
who needs you,Words and music by John Deacon. I make it half past six you come at seven. Always try to keep me hanging round. You little spoilt thing girl you kept me waiting. Never contemplating my point of view. This comes as no surprise. I'm a fool for I believed your lies. But now I've seen through your disguise. Who needs well I don't need who needs you?. Oh I believed you. Went on my knees to you. How I trusted you. But you turned me down. But it's dog eat dog in this rat race. And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face. Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand. Where is that helping hand?. I like it I like it. Well I don't need you. How I was pushed around. Don't let it get you down. You walked all over me. But don't you ever give in. Taking one step forward slipping two steps back. There's an empty feeling that you can't forget. Reaching out for a helping hand. When I met you you were always charming. Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine. You were oh so so sophisticated. Never interested in what I'd say. I had to swallow my pride. So naive you took me for a ride. But now I'm the one to decide
