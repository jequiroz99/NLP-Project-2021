You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart. I'll see you on the street some other time. And all our words would just fall outta line. While we're dreamin'. Straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make one more start. You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart
summer of '69,"I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five and dime. Played till my fingers bled. Was the summer of '69. Me and some guys from school. Had a band and we tried real hard. Jimmy quit and Jody got married. I shoulda known we'd never get far. oh when I look back now. That summer seemed to last forever. And if I had the choice. Ya - I'd always wanna be there. Those were the best days of my life. Ain't no use in complainin'. When you got a job to do. Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in. And that's when I met you - yah. Standin' on your mama's porch. You told me that you'd wait forever. Oh and when you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Back in the summer of '69. Man we were killin' time. We were young and restless. We needed to unwind. I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no.... And now the times are changin'. Look at everything that's come and gone. Sometimes when I play that old six string. I think about ya'n wonder what went wrong. Standin' on your mama's porch. You told me it would last forever. Oh the way you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Back in the summer of '69"

black pearl,Deep down in Mississippi. I found my sweet delta blues. She weaved a little southern spell on me. Made a little voodoo. She was born the bright side of midnight. When her mama was seventeen. She was a hot blooded - god fearin' - gospel girl. The finest that I ever seen. She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream. Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream. Black pearl - my kinda girl. Just the kind of thing to rock my world. Black pearl - she's my kinda girl. Met her in a dixie diner. Put on the southern hospitality. I can still smell her sweet molasses. Running all over me. We started rollin' like the river. Like a twister tearin' through the town. Tongue tied - satisfied - 'n southern fried. As she drove this ol' dixie down. She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream. Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream. Black pearl - my kinda girl. Just the kind of thing to rock my world. Black pearl - she's my kinda girl. Yeah she's alright - yeah she's ok. Makin' love night - she really made my day.

heat of the night,I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream. Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream. Pull the cover up high. And pray for the mornin' light. Cause you're livin' alone. In the heat of the night. Met a man with a message from the other side. Couldn't take the pressure. Had to leave it behind. He said it's up to you. You can run or you can fight (Ya that's right). Better leave it alone. In the heat of the night. In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around. There'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down. In the heat of the night. (Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down). (Don't look back don't ever turn around). Had to pay the piper to call the tune. Said he'd be back someday. Said he'd be back real soon. Pull the shades down low. You'll know when the time is right. When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night

home again,When I was younger. My life was torn asunder. And I was carried far away. Now somewhere in the distance. I feel a strange insistance. I long to be there once again. The day is drawing nearer. The time has come to leave here. The feeling just keeps gettin' stronger every day. So I pray for the moment when I'll be with you. And all that we hoped for is all comin' true. When the time we've spent waitin' is finally through. I'll be home again. I can still remember. Days that never ended. Standin' on a distant shore. With every raindrop fallin'. I hear the thunder callin'. Like so many times before. Sometimes in the darkness. I hear what my heart says. Maybe one day I'll know what that feelings for. So I wait for the moment when I'll be with you. And all that we hoped for is all comin' true. The time we've spent waitin' is finally through. I'll be home again. When you're out there on your own. It can chill you to the bone. There's a cold wind blowin'. But it feels good knowin'. The worst is over now - I'm finally goin' home. It's gettin' stronger. Can't wait any longer.
homeland,Was it some man that didn't treat you right. Left you reaching out for him in the middle of the night. Is there some heartache that you can't out run. That makes you so afraid to get close to anyone. You're so - easy to look at. You're so easy to hold. It's so easy to touch you - but so hard to let go. It's so easy to want you - that I can't get enough. Tell me why do ya have to be. Why do ya have to be so hard to love. Is it some hurt from long ago. That makes it so hard to let your feelings show. Is it the ghost of who you used to be. That makes you so afraid to bear your soul to me

if wishes were horses,"Come with me you can wish upon a star. You can do all the things that you've longed to. And you won't have to wonder who you are. You can be anybody you want to. In a land full of promises and kings. All your best laid dreams are for catchin'. You can have the world to tie up on a string. Just close your eyes and imagine. If wishes were horses. Beggars would ride. All dreams and desires would ride along side. Worries and troubles would fall off behind. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. To a land far or near come along. There's an all new-round everyday glow. Like the young girl sang in the song. ""Somewhere over the rainbow"""

into the fire,Life - thin as a thread. Sometimes you're lucky. Sometimes you're better off dead. Your first breath is taken and in to the world you are cast. You long for tomorrow while living each day as your last. Well I know what your heart desires. But you can't take it with you. Into the fire. Now you've done all you can. Your life's at the crossroads. You watch as it slips through your hands. So stand on the mountain and shout in vain at the sky. But nobody hears you - the words only echo inside. Oh shelter the flame - it may expire. Risin' up from the ashes. Into the fire. Just hold on to your life down to the wire. Oh out from the dragon's jaws. Into the fire. There's a moment in every man's life. When he must decide what is wrong and what's right. You could wait for your dreams to come true. But time has no mercy. Time won't stand still for you. Well I know what your heart desires. Crawlin' out from the wreckage. Into the fire. Here I go...into the fire. I know...what your heart desires.

native son,"I've seen many moons through these wrinkled eyes. The years have made me old but they've made me wise. Now the white man lives where our rivers run. For now better days have passed.

Iâ€™ll get in the do, â€œI did itâ€. Shoo-bee-dooâ€™s and all. Watchinâ€™ the grass around. A rollinâ€™ round to good old passion rockâ€™nâ€™roll. Iâ€™ll be here in the early morning. Tearinâ€™ down these walls. The music played and I must say I really had a ball. And now I guess I gotta go and meet those odd people down the hall. I donâ€™t wanna go this way. Though I know Iâ€™ve gotta pay. Would it change things anyway. If I said Iâ€™d like to stay?. What da ya say?."

I shouldn't let it get to me,. There's nothin' I can do.. Think that you should know by now,. You've done the damage now it can't be changed,. So give me one good reason,. One good reason to stay.. Well I knew that you were sleepin'. And I didn't want to wake you,. Cause this troubled look I got,. Might make you change your mind.. There's no need for compensation,. There's no reason to foresake me,. I was looking for the answers,. But there's nothin' here to find.."

Pretendin' it ain't there. Oh - and now we're left with nothin'. When the mornin' breaks. We go our separate ways. If the night was made for love it ain't for keeps. But I lose control.

rebel,"He made his way back to the old town. And everything looked just the same. The shops and the schools and the factories were there. But somehow the faces had changed. So he went for a walk in the high street. Took his coat off and rolled up his sleeves. He thought of his father and his father before him. And how he was the first one to leave. Well he didn't come here for forgiveness. There isn't a lot they can say. Cause I remember the reasons he first ran away. He's a rebel. Just a rebel. Got his back to the wall. Gonna fight 'til he falls. He's a rebel. Don't ever look back - don't surrender. The old men say they've seen it before. Oh they drink their beer and they talk about friends. Who didn't come back from the war. Don't say he's too young to remember. Don't tell him what's wrong or what's right. Just give him a chance to get out there and fight. He's a rebel. Just a rebel. All the battles are won. But he's still on the run. He's a rebel. When it comes time for leavin'. Don't stand in my way. There's nothin' left for me here. Gonna run, run away. In the morning he walks past the old house. In the rain under grey northern sky. There's a new coat of paint on the front garden gate. But there's more there than first meets the eye. For a moment he stands undecided. Looking back on the days of his youth. As two worlds collide in a moment of truth. He's a rebel."

remembrance day,For our king and our country and the promise of glory. We came from Kingston and Brighton to fight on the front line. Just lads from the farms and boys from the cities. Not meant to be soldiers we lay in the trenches. We'd face the fighting with a smile - or so we said. If only we had known what danger lay ahead. The sky turned to grey as we went into battle. On the fields of Europe young men were fallin'. I'll be back for you someday - it won't be long. If I can just hold on 'til this bloody war is over. The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day. There'll be no more fighting on Remembrance Day. By October of 18 Cambrai had fallen. Soon the war would be over and we'd be returnin'. Don't forget me while I'm gone far away. Well it won't be long 'till I'm back there in your arms again. One day soon - I don't know when. You know we'll all be free and the bells of peace will ring again. The time will come for you and me. We'll be goin' home when this bloody war is ended. The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day. We'll all say a prayer on Remembrance Day. On Remembrance Day - say a little prayer. On Remembrance Day. Well the guns will be silent. There'll be no more fighting. Oh we'll lay down our weapons. On Remembrance Day.

rock and roll music,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music. Any old way you choose it's got a back beat, you can't lose it. Any old time you use it's gotta be rock and roll music. If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me. Got no kick against modern jazz. Unless they try to play it too darn fast. And lose the beauty of the melody. Until they sound just like a symphony. That's why I go for that rock and roll music. Any old way you choose it's got a back beat, you can't lose it. Any old time you use it's gotta be rock and roll music. If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me. I tok my loved one over across the tracks. So she can hear my man awail a sax.

Any old time you use it's gotta be rock and roll music. If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me. Way down south they had a jubilee. The jokey folks they had a jamboree. They're drinking home brew from a water cup. The folks dancing there are all shook up. And started playing that rock and roll music. Any old time you use it's got a back beat, you can't lose it. Any old time you use it's gotta be rock and roll music. If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me. Don't care to hear them play a tango. And in the mood they take a mambo. It's way to early for a congo. So keep a rocking that piano. That's why I go for that rock and roll music. Any old time you use it's got a back beat, you can't lose it. Any old time you use it. Gotta be rock and roll music. If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me"

room service,By: Igor Freitas. When a hotel room's the closest thing you got to home. You could be in Philadelphia you could even be in Rome. You gotta dial nine to get an outside line. I even need a concierge just to take a drive - it's a crazy life. I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong. It's a different melody but the same old song.... Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life. Been around the world 'bout a thousand times. Still a knock on the door makes me nervous. I think I'll see you standing there - but no. It's only room service - ya room service. I've been living out my suitcase as long as I remember. Life's the same - it doesn't change - it's a gibson or a fender. I still think about you babe - I swear sometimes I see your face. These are crazy days. Ya I think I hear your voice - but it's just a dream. It's a brand new movie but the same old scene. Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life. Been around the world 'bout a thousand times. Still a knock on the door makes me nervous. I think I'll see you standing there - but no. It's only room service - ya room service. Ya know I wouldn't change a thing - no. I'm just waiting for the bell in room to ring. I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong. It's a different melody but the same old song.... By Igor Freitas

That I wasn't all alone and I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. Baby I was saved. Love threw out a line. Oh I was saved. Well you washed me in forgiveness. Healed me with your touch. Such a beautiful redemption. Such a strong and simple love. Well I know it wasn't Jesus. That taught me to believe. It was the power of your sweet love. That brought me to my knees. Baby I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. And love threw out a line and I was saved. Like mohammed to the mountain. Like a secret to the truth. I was searching for the answers. That I found inside of you. I was saved. I was saved. Deep down in my soul. I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. Love threw out a line. Just in time. Love threw out a line. And I was saved

she believes in me,i'm tossing and turning and i can't get to sleep. got something on my mind - i just can't release. then she whispers so softly - that she believes in me. if i let her down - and tried to disguise it. she always see through it always replies that. no matter what i do - she believes in me. all the times i failed - gone slighty off the rails. she's there to remind me - she believes in me. when it all goes wrong and i feel i'm own. she's there to remind me - she believes in me. don't get me wrong - i not some kind of fool. i give her my world if she asked me to. cuz here's no denying - she believes in me. but i'm only human - i'm just a guy. that sometimes makes mistakes and i can't explain why. some say crazy - but she believes in me.

There's nothin' I can show. That she don't know about me. Round and round and round we go. Neither here or neither there. All I know, without her in my life. I'd be nowhere. Well, feelings come and feelings go. But some things never change. Like the light that shimmers in her eyes. It stays the same. Oh, she knows me. When I'm wrong or when I'm right. She knows me. In the middle of the night. She holds me. And I don't say a word. Cuz words could never save me. She's got a permanent hold on my heart. And I'm learning to live with the loneliness.

she's got a way,"she's got a way - of getting inside your soul. she'd breach the walls of jericho. make you fall like virgin snow. she's got a smile, makes you forget the things. you were only just thinking about. it kind of turns me inside out. and if i try to conceal, she's got a way to reveal. i feel so naked - i feel so totally exposed. it's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me. i feel so shaken - and it's like everybody knows. whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me. ya she's got a way. she's got a way - of taming the wild in me. with patience and serenity. I'm drowning in her revery. and i can't run away she's got a way to make me stay. she comes to me like rain falls down my window. sure as night will follow day - i'll surrender. ya she's got a way. .

she's only happy when she's dancin',"Monday mornin' - it's time to get up. Two cups of coffee and she runs for the bus. Looks in the window and fixes her hair. Nobody notices and nobody cares. She admits it ain't no kinda life. Workin' 9 to 5 you know.... She's only happy when she's dancin'. There ain't no place she'd rather be. When she's dancin'. Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies. When Friday evenin' finally rolls around. She grabs a taxi and she heads uptown. Goes to a place they call ""The Ball And Chain"". Nothin' matters until Monday so she goes insane. Well it's a bitch tryin' to make ends meet. But that's the way the story goes. She's only happy when she's dancin'. There ain't nothin' makes her feel so free. When she's dancin'. The girl's outrageous and it's plain to see. Solo. She ain't got much but she got independence. Ya - she's doin' alright. His eyes are on her as the evenin's endin'. But she ain't goin' for no mystery. Because nobody rides for free. She's only happy when she's dancin'. Dancin' - there ain't no place she'd rather be. When she's dancin'. Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies - dancin'."

Sheâ€™s one of a kind and I sure am glad that I met her. I couldnâ€™t have found one much better. But thereâ€™s something we all should know. Sheâ€™s a kind of a gnu that belongs in a zoo. Shut up, shut up. Donâ€™t tell me that my best friends like Alice. Who might wind up in a looking-glass palace. Itâ€™s all right with me, if she wants to be. As naughty as the day she was born.

We were young and restless. We needed to unwind. I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no.... And now the times are changin'. Look at everything that's come and gone. Sometimes when I play that old six string. I think about ya'n wonder what went wrong. Standin' on your mama's porch. You told me it would last forever. Oh the way you held my hand.

tantalize,"Words and music by Gilder and McCulloch. From the east-side street, kick a tin can beat. Run through the jungle, a lion, a mongrel like you.. Such an easy mark for a hungry shark. Lost in the haze of the big city maze and itâ€™s through. Tantalize you, mesmerize you. Trick you with a smile. Capture with the style. A touch of magic sure to make you sigh. Can you still be a sail with this ball and chain. Run through the jungle, a lecher, a scoundrel, itâ€™s you. Keep yourself wide-eyed or theyâ€™ll bleed you dry. Runninâ€™ thru shadows of streets broad and narrow with you. Tantalize you, mesmerize you. Start to lose control. The city takes its toll. Beaten once, twice, shy, beware the law. Do you see (do you see). At nights (at nights). Do you see (do you see). At nights (at nights)."

Only we can make the difference. Don't ya know that tears are not enough. If we can pull together. We could change the world forever. Heaven knows that tears are not enough. It's up to me and you. To make the dream come true. It's time to take our message everywhere. C'est l'amour qui nous rassemble. D'ici Ã  l'autre bout du monde. Let's show them Canada still cares. You know that we'll be there. If we should try together you and I. Maybe we could understand the reasons why. If we take a stand every woman, child and man. We can make it work for God's sake lend a hand."

the best was yet to come,Just a small town girl in the city lights. The best was yet to come. Then lonely days turned to endless nights. The best was yet to come. How were you to know. That you would be the lucky one. Ain't it funny how time flies. When the best was yet to come. You can cry yourself to sleep at night. You can't change the things you've done. You had it there then it slipped away. Yeah you left the song unsung. Even through your tears. I never saw you come undone. What's so good about goodbye. When the best was yet to come. I find myself thinkin' about yesterday. When you were here and livin' in a dream. In the moment that it takes. You find you made your first mistake. Like the setting sun.... You turn around it's gone. Just a small time girl who had it made. Or so the story goes. She had it there then it slipped away. Oh - how was she to know. Even through her tears. I never saw her come undone. Ain't it funny how time flies. When the best was yet to come. What's so good about goodbye. When the best was yet to come.

this side of paradise,"""This Side Of Paradise"". I'm ridin' in the back seat - nine years old. Starin' out the window countin' the highway poles. And then I get to thinkin' - that it don't seem real. I'm flyin' through the universe in a '69 oldsmobile. And I wanna know what they're not tellin'. And I don't wanna hear no lies. I just want something to believe in. Ah - it's a lonely lonely road I'm on. This side of paradise. I'm ridin' in the back seat - black limousine. Starin' out the window at a funeral scene. And then I get to thinkin' - and it don't seem right. I'm sittin' here safe and sound and someone I love is gone tonight. I wanna know what they're not tellin'. And I don't wanna hear no lies. I just want something to believe in. Ah - it's a lonely, lonely road we're on. This side of paradise. There ain't no crystal ball - there ain't no santa claus. There ain't no fairy tales. There ain't no streets of gold. There ain't no chosen few - ya it's just me and you. And that's all we got ya...that's all we got to hold on to. Ya this side of paradise. I remember bein' a little boy in the backseat - nine years old. Always askin' questions - never did what I was told. And then I get to thinkin' like I always do. We wander 'round in the darkness but every now and then. A little light shines through. I want to know what they're not telling. I don't wanna hear no lies. I just want something to believe in. Ah - it's a lonely lonely road we're on. This side of paradise"

vanishing,People all over build on solid ground. They build it up and then they tear it down. Take it or leave it who cares how much it costs. They'll never know how much is gone until it's lost. 'til it's vanishing. Think I hear thunder ain't no sign of rain. Danger signs flashin' in my brain. Ridin' on empty-lights are turnin' red. There ain't no lovin' left in this empty bed. Ya it's vanishing. We're sittin' on treasure call it sacred ground. Why look for more babe when it's right here to be found. Never gonna lose ya-ya know I'm gonna fight. This thing's worth saving girl-ya know we'll make it right. If it takes all night-gonna swim your sea. Gonna sail your ocean-gonna shake your tree. Gonna climb your moutain-gonna shine your light. Wanna row your river darlin'-if it takes all night. People all over build mansions in the sky. They choke on smoke and watch their dreams go by. When the phone stops ringin' love has surely died. But the grass is greener babe on the other side. Never wanna lose ya-ya know I'm gonna fight. Never said it'd be easy girl-ya know we'll make it right. If it takes all night-gonna swim your sea. Gonna sail your ocean-gonna shake your tree. Gonna climb your moutain-gonna shine your light. Wanna row your river darlin'-if it takes all night. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Whatcha gonna do without a shoulder to lean on. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Never wanna lose ya-ya know we gotta fight. Never said it'd be easy girl-ya know we'll get it right....

victim of love,Livin' on your own can be a lonely game. A face in the crowd - no one knows your name. Itâ€™s a table for one and a broken heart to go. She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed. Would come to stay and never wanna leave. But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow. Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of. Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love. It doesn't matter who was right or wrong. When the fire is over - when the magic's gone. You pick up the pieces and do the best you can. It knocks you down but you try it again. You get a little older it's a cryin' shame. Sometimes things don't work out like you plan. Who's gonna help when you've had enough. It ain't no secret you're a victim of love. Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of. Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love. One goodbye was really all it took. Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book. But somehow all the numbers look the same. You've been thinkin' how to get around it. But there ain't nothin' you can do about it. Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained. Ain't nothin' you can't rise above. Call it what you want but you're a victim of love. Who's gonna help you when you've had enough. Ain't no secret you're a victim of love. I don't wanna lose your love....

I know there´ll be a time for you and I. Just take my hand we´ll runaway. We´ll pick up all the pieces of our shattered dreams. ´Cause we´ll be comin´ back - comin´ back to stay"
when you love someone,When you love someone - you'll do anything. You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain. You'll shoot the moon - put out the sun. When you love someone. You'll deny the truth - believe a lie. There'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly. But your lonely nights - have just begun. When you love someone. When you love someone - you'll feel it deep inside. And nothin else can ever change your mind. When you want someone - when you need someone. When you love someone.... When you love someone - you'll sacrifice. You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice. You'd risk it all - no matter what may come. When you love someone. You'll shoot the moon - put out the sun. When you love someone
when you're gone (feat. melanie c),"I've been wandering around the house all night. wondering what the hell to do. Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but all I can think of is you. well the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home. I'm tired of being all alone. Got the tv on 'cause the radio's playing. songs that remind me of you. Baby when you're gone, I realize I'm in love. days go on and on, and the nights just seem so long. Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should. things just feel so wrong, baby when you're gone. I've driving up and down these streets. trying to find somewhere to go. Yeah I'm looking for a familiar face, but there's no one I know. oh, this is torture, this is pain, it feels like I'm gonna go insane. I hope you're coming back real soon, 'cause I don't know what to do. Baby when you're gone, I realize I'm in love. days go on and on, and the nights just seem so long. Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should. things just feel so wrong, baby when you're gone. Baby when you're gone, I realize I'm in love. days go on and on and the nights just seem so long. Even food don't taste that good, drink ain't doing what it should. things just feel so wrong, baby when you're gone"
where angels fear to tread,well i'm wrapped around your finger. i'm never letting go. you know i'm happy just to linger. and let the feeling flow. this must be an illusion. i know this can't be real. but right here and right now. this is paradise i feel. i never thought i'd find someone to move me. someone who could see right thru me. you found your way into my head. where even angels fear to tread. don't wanna go out walkin. don't wanna take a drive. don't wanna move from this sweet spot baby. while this feelin's still alive. the way we fit together. it's like we're meant to be. and right here and right now. this is paradise to me.
where do i go from here,All of these miles and where I been. All of this time that I´ve wasted. All of my dreams they´re just gone like the wind. Ya - I´ve got to face it. There´s nowhere to go from here. Standin´ here cold and shaken. How did I lose my way?. On this long lonely road that I´ve taken. Now that I´ve come to the end of the line. Now that I´ve run out of chanses. Evertyhing I love - has been left behind. And I don´t have the answers. Where do I go from here?. Standin´ here tired and broken. How do I find my way?. On this long lonely road where I´m goin´. It´s gonna be a long lonely road where I´m goin´. I´m gonna get there
why do you have to be so hard to love,Was it some man that didn't treat you right. Left you reaching out for him in the middle of the night. Is there some heartache that you can't out run. That makes you so afraid to get close to anyone. You're so - easy to look at. You're so easy to hold. It's so easy to touch you - but so hard to let go. It's so easy to want you - that I can't get enough. Tell me why do ya have to be. Why do ya have to be so hard to love. Is it some hurt from long ago. That makes it so hard to let your feelings show. Is it the ghost of who you used to be. That makes you so afraid to bear your soul to me

"win some, lose some","Now you know. That I stood outside your window. Just a little too long.. What you're gonna do. When the hours pass away. And you know that I'm gone.. Well, it may be a week,. It may be a day,. I'm six blocks over. And I don't know what to say to you.. Jokin' 'bout your mama. Went a little too far.. But you caught me. Out with the others. Till the early dawn.. There may be a time. If we played it right. I'm six blocks over. And you wanna spend a night with me.. Now the hours and the minutes. Just fly away.. You win some and you lose some,. You gotta get it right. Or I'll be saying. Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye.. Thinkin' back to. The way you're holdin' me down,. I'd be better off dead.. Now you know. That the time is running out. Of the things we said.. Well, it may be a week,. It may be a day,. I'm six blocks over. And I don't know what to say to you.. Now the hours and the minutes. Just fly away..

yesterday was just a dream,"Lock the door and close the curtain. No more lies, I'm tired of hurtin'. I think you know what I mean. There's an empty sound that lonely makes. Don't know how much more that I can take. And yesterday was just a dream. Yesterday was just a dream. Nothing's ever what it seems. Tomorrow's comin' it won't be long. Yesterday is here and gone. Words tumble out like an open book. While the world was turning, something shook. From a whisper to a scream. Rain's beatin' down on the window pane. Makes me wonder about you again. And yesterday was just a dream. Yesterday was just a dream. Nothin's ever what it seems. Tomorrow's comin' it won't be long. Yesterday is here and gone. Tell me what's it for, this life we're living. The world is cold and unforgiving. And your smile is so serene. Yesterday was just a dream. Nothin's ever what it seems. Tomorrow's comin' it won't be long. Yesterday is here and gone. Ma, it's here and gone"
