friday i'm in love,"I don't care if Monday's blue. Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too. Thursday, I don't care about you. It's Friday, I'm in love. Monday you can fall apart.

I don't care if Monday's black. Tuesday, Wednesday - heart attack. Thursday, never looking back. It's Friday, I'm in love. Monday you can hold your head. Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed. Oh Thursday, watch the walls instead. It's Friday, I'm in love. Saturday wait. And Sunday always comes too late. But Friday never hesitate.... Dressed up to the eyes. It's a wonderful surprise. To see your shoes and your spirits rise. Throwing out your frown. And just smiling at the sound. And as sleek as a shriek. Spinning round and round. Always take a big bite. It's such a gorgeous sight. To see you eat in the middle of the night. You can never get enough. Enough of this stuff. It's Friday. I'm in love. I don't care if Monday's blue. Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too. Thursday I don't care about you. It's Friday I'm in love. Monday, you can fall apart. Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart. Thursday doesn't even start. It's Friday I'm in love"
boys don't cry,I would say I'm sorry. If I thought that it would change your mind. But I know that this time. I have said too much. Been too unkind. I try to laugh about it. Cover it all up with lies. I try to. Laugh about it. Hiding the tears in my eyes. Because boys don't cry. Boys don't cry. I would break down at your feet. And beg forgiveness. Plead with you. But I know that. It's too late. And now there's nothing I can do. So I try to laugh about it. Cover it all up with lies. I try to. laugh about it. Hiding the tears in my eyes. 'cause boys don't cry. Boys don't cry. I would tell you. That I loved you. If I thought that you would stay. But I know that it's no use. That you've already. Gone away. Misjudged your limits. Pushed you too far. Took you for granted. I thought that you needed me more. Now I would do most anything. To get you back by my side. But I just. Keep on laughing. Hiding the tears in my eyes. 'cause boys don't cry. Boys don't cry. Boys don't cry
just like heaven,"Show me, show me, show me. How you do that trick. ""The one that makes me scream,"" she said. ""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said. And threw her arms around my neck. Show me how you do it. And I promise you, I promise that. I'll run away with you. I'll run away with you. Spinning on that dizzy edge. I kissed her face, I kissed her neck. And dreamed of all the different ways. I had to make her glow. ""Why are you so far away,"" she said. ""Why won't you ever know. that I'm in love with you,. That I'm in love with you?"". You... soft and only. You... lost and lonely. You... strange as angels. Dancing in the deepest oceans. Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream. Just like a dream. Daylight whipped me into shape. I must have been asleep for days. And moving lips to breathe her name. I open up my eyes. I find myself alone, alone, alone. Above a raging sea. That stole the only girl I loved. And drowned her deep inside of me.. You... soft and only. You... lost and lonely. You... just like heaven"

And I know I was wrong. when I said it was true. that it couldn't be me and be her. in between without you. without you. Yesterday I got so scared. I shivered like a child. Yesterday away from you. it froze me deep inside. come back come back. don't walk away. come back come back. come back today. come back come back. why can't you see. come back come back. come back to me. And I know I was wrong. when I said it was true. that it couldn't be me and be her. in between without you. without you. Smith

pictures of you,I've been looking so long at these pictures of you. That I almost believe that they're real. I've been living so long with my pictures of you. That I almost believe that the pictures. are all I can feel. Remembering you standing quiet in the rain. As I ran to your heart to be near. And we kissed as the sky fell in. Holding you close. how I always held close in your fear. remembering you. Running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow. And screamed at the make-believe. Screamed at the sky. And you finally found all your courage to let it all go. Remembering you fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of you heart. You were stone white. So delicate. So lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. Remembering you. How you used to be slow drowned. You were angels so much more than everything. Oh hold for the last time then slip away. Quietly open my eyes. But I never see anything. If only i'd thought of the right words. I could have held onto your heart. If only i'd thought of the right words. I wouldn't be breaking apart all my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you. But I never hold onto your heart. Looking so long for the words to be true. But always just breaking apart my pictures of you. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to feel you deep in my heart. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to never feel the breaking apart all my pictures of you
close to me,I've waited hours for this. I've made myself so sick. I wish I'd stayed asleep today. I never thought this day would end. I never thought tonight could ever be. This close to me. Just try to see in the dark. Just try to make it work. To feel the fear before you're here. I make the shapes come much too close. I pull my eyes out. Hold my breath. And wait until I shake.... But if I had your faith. Then I could make it safe and clean. If only I was sure. That my head on the door was a dream. I've waited hours for this. I've made myself so sick. I wish I'd stayed asleep today. I never thought this day would end. I never thought tonight could ever be. This close to me. But if I had your face. I could make it safe and clean. If only I was sure. That my head on the door. Was a dream

lullaby,"On candystripe legs the spiderman comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. and suddenly. A movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do. When I realise with fright. That the spiderman is having me. for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now. Closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me. and his tongue in my eyes. ""Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy"". Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"". And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning I will wake up. In the shivering cold. And the spiderman is always hungry..."
a forest,Come closer and see. See into the trees. Find the girl. While you can. Come closer and see. See into the dark. Just follow your eyes. Just follow your eyes. I hear her voice. Calling my name. The sound is deep. In the dark. I hear her voice. And start to run. Into the trees. Into the trees. Into the trees. Suddenly I stop. But I know it's too late. I'm lost in a forest. All alone. The girl was never there. It's always the same. I'm running towards nothing. Again and again and again
a letter to elise,"Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say. I just can't stay here every yesterday. like keep on acting out the same. the way we act out. Every way to smile, forget. And make-believe we never needed. Any more than this. Any more than this. Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do. I know I'll never really get inside of you. to make your eyes catch fire. the way they should. The way the blue could pull me in. If they only would. If they only would. At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else. that hides away. From me and you. there're worlds to part. With aching looks and breaking hearts. And all the prayers your hands can make. Oh I just take as much as you can throw. and then throw it all away. Oh I throw it all away. like throwing faces at the sky. like throwing arms round. Yesterday, I stood and stared. wide-eyed in front of you. And the face I saw looked back. the way I wanted to. But I just can't hold my tears away. the way you do. Elise believe I never wanted this. I thought this time I'd keep. all of my promises. I thought you were the girl always dreamed about. but I let the dream go. and the promises broke. and the make-believe ran out.... Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say. I just can't stay here every yesterday. like keep on acting out the same. the way we act out. every way to smile, forget. and make-believe we never needed. any more than this. any more than this. and every time I try to pick it up. like falling sand. as fast as I pick it up. it runs away through my clutching hands. but there's nothing else I can really do. there's nothing else. I can really do. at all..."
let's go to bed,Let me take your hand. I'm shaking like milk. Turning. Turning blue. All over the windows and the floors. Fires outside in the sky. Look as perfect as cats. The two of us together again. But it's just the same. Stupid game. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't say it. If you don't say it first. You think you're tired now. But wait until six.... Laughing at the Christmas lights. You remember. From December. All of this then back again. Another girl. Another name. Stay alive but stay the same. It's just the same. Stupid game. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't play it. If you don't play it first. You can't even see now. So you ask me the way. You wonder if it's true. Because it couldn't be rain.... Through the right doorway. And into the white room. It used to be the dust that would lay here. When I came here alone. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't say it. If you don't say it first. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Let's go to bed!. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Let's go to bed!
underneath the stars,"Floating here. Like this with you. Underneath the stars. Aligned. For 13 billion years. The view. It's beautiful. And ours alone tonight. Underneath the stars. Spinning round. And round with you. Watching shadows. Melt the light. So shining. From our eyes. A tear. Another space is ours. Alone tonight. Watch as shadows melt. The waves, break. The waves, break. Whisper in my ear, a wish. ""We could drift away so far"". Your voice. Inside of my head. Like this. It's infinite. The hours alone tonight. We could drift away. Flying here. Like this with you. Underneath the stars. Aligned. For 13 billion years. The view. It's beautiful. And ours alone tonight. Underneath the stars. (Everything is gone?). Everything Gone. ?? still to ??. Together as now. Forever as one. In each other's arms. So near and so far. Together as now. Underneath the stars. As the waves, break"

the lovecats,We move like cagey tigers. We couldn't get closer than this. The way we walk. The way we talk. The way we stalk. The way we kiss. We slip through the streets. While everyone sleeps. Getting bigger and sleeker. And wider and brighter. We bite and scratch and scream all night. Let's go and throw. All the songs we know.... Into the sea. You and me. All these years and no one heard. I'll show you in spring. It's a treacherous thing. We missed you hissed the lovecats. We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully. Wonderfully pretty!. Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.... We should have each other to tea huh?. We should have each other with cream. Then curl up by the fire. And sleep for awhile. It's the grooviest thing. It's the perfect dream. Into the sea. You and me. All these years and no one heard. I'll show you in spring. It's a treacherous thing. We missed you hissed the lovecats. We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully. Wonderfully pretty!. Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.... We should have each other to dinner huh?. We should have each other with cream. Then curl up in the fire. Get up for awhile. It's the grooviest thing. It's the perfect dream. Hand in hand. Is the only way to land. And always the right way round. Not broken in pieces. Like hated little meeces.... How could we miss. Someone as dumb as this?. I love you... let's go.... Oh... solid gone.... How could we miss. Someone as dumb as this?.
charlotte sometimes,All the faces. All the voices blur. Change to one face. Change to one voice. Prepare yourself for bed. The light seems bright. And glares on white walls. All the sounds of. Charlotte sometimes. Into the night with. Charlotte sometimes. Night after night she lay alone in bed. Her eyes so open to the dark. The streets all looked so strange. They seemed so far away. But Charlotte did not cry. The people seemed so close. Playing expressionless games. The people seemed. So close. So many. Other names.... Sometimes I'm dreaming. Where all the other people dance. Sometimes I'm dreaming. Charlotte sometimes. Sometimes I'm dreaming. Expressionless the trance. Sometimes I'm dreaming. So many different names. Sometimes I'm dreaming. The sounds all stay the same. Sometimes I'm dreaming. She hopes to open shadowed eyes. On a different world. Come to me. Scared princess. Charlotte sometimes. On that bleak track. (See the sun is gone again). The tears were pouring down her face. She was crying and crying for a girl. Who died so many years before.... Sometimes I dream. Where all the other people dance. Sometimes I dream. Charlotte sometimes. Sometimes I dream. The sounds all stay the same. Sometimes I'm dreaming. There are so many different names. Sometimes I dream. Sometimes I dream.... Charlotte sometimes crying for herself. Charlotte sometimes dreams a wall around herself. But it's always with love. With so much love it looks like. Everything else. Of Charlotte sometimes. So far away. Glass sealed and pretty. Charlotte sometimes.
pornography,A hand in my mouth. A life spills into the flowers. We all look so perfect. As we all fall down. In an electric glare. The old man cracks with age. She found his last picture. In the ashes of the fire. An image of the queen. Echoes round the sweating bed. Sour yellow sounds inside my head. In books. And films. And in life. And in heaven. The sound of slaughter. As your body turns. But it's too late. One more day like today and I'll kill you. A desire for flesh. And real blood. I'll watch you drown in the shower. Pushing my life through your open eyes. I must fight this sickness. Find a cure. I must fight this sickness....

a night like this,"Say goodbye on a night like this. If it's the last thing you ever do. You never looked as lost as this. Sometimes it doesn't even look like you. It goes dark it goes darker still please stay. But I watch you like I'm made of stone as you walk away. I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night. A witch hunt for another girl. For always and ever is always for you. You just the most georgeously stupid thing I've ever cursed in the world. Say hello for a day like today, say it every time you move. The way that you look at me now. Makes me wish I was you. It goes deep it goes deeper still. This touch and the smile and the shake of your head and the smile. And the shake of your head.

killing an arab,Standing on a beach. With a gun in my hand. Staring at the sea. Staring at the sand. Staring down the barrel. At the arab on the ground. See his open mouth. But hear no sound. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab. I can turn and walk away. Or I can fire the gun. Staring at the sky. Staring at the sun. Whichever I choose. It amounts to the same. Absolutely nothing. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab. Feel the steel butt jump. Smooth in my hand. Staring at the sea. Staring at the sand. Staring at myself. Reflected in the eyes of. The dead man on the beach. The dead man. On the beach. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab.

if only tonight we could sleep,If only tonight we could sleep. In a bed made of flowers. If only tonight we could fall. In a deathless spell. If only tonight we could slide. Into deep black water. And breathe. And breathe.... Then an angel would come. With burning eyes like stars. And bury us deep. In his velvet arms. And the rain would cry. As our faces slipped away. And the rain would cry. Don't let it end....

2 late,So I'll wait for you. Where I always wait. Behind the signs that sell the news. I'll watch for you like yesterday. And hope for you. One day that once. Spent out on me. And up 'til late. I search for you. Your hat pushed straight. Away from me. Your measured step. Heads up you win. Always too late. If I could just once catch your eye. Invisible against the words. That hold you down in solitude. And never let you go. The way that every time. My eyes just close. Like lids of wooden men in file. I put you under rainy day. Your hat's all off. And I'm gone away.

a chain of flowers,Please wake up. It's so dark and cold. Please wake up. I feel so alone. And I feel so scared. That you're going away. And I feel so scared.... All I want is summer. Stories from before. Just like the day you tried to hide. Behind the churchyard wall. And fell asleep before I came.... I found you. In a chain of flowers. Sleeping like a marble girl. Sleeping in another world.... I'll never tell you. Of all the different ways. You make me so afraid...
a few hours after this...,The look before I go. Is the look for you. You only have to look and it will all come true. And we can fall outside. Into the fizzy night. Or pull me down in here. You know it's all the same. I only want to see if you are happy again. Or we can roll around. And find out upside down. A few hours after this and we're apart again. Like two white checks. Like opposite poles. In a secret game. (Like nothing like these I suppose...). I really should have known by the cut of your smile. That the answer would be simple. It still took you awhile to get it out of me. I thought you'd do it easily. Just put your hands around my heart. And squeeze me until I'm dry. I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why. I never saw you again
a foolish arrangement,"Christabel strips. And slips like a dream. Breaking ice with arms that gleam with pain. Disdain.... She throws her head. And glides against the stream. Throwing me her bravest smile. Defiant. Glittering. Shivering guile. ""Catching a cold is quick this time. But fish?... Fish may take a while..."". Christabel dips and slips from me. And hand pushed deep inside is suddenly free. Triumphant. Reluctantly. Struggling six legs held up for me to see. ""Don't be scared. It's nothing new. It's the same old game; only fun with two..."". But fast and over and over. ""I can't play this game with you"". Everything she tries to tell me. Leaves me open mouthed and still. Foolishly arrange tomorrow. The way I always will. Christabel trips. And grips my hand. But never to be saved. For a second I understand. And I fall with her.... ""I'll never leave you. Love you. See you change into the man I want. But it's not for long this thing. It's not for long..."""
a forest,Come closer and see. See into the trees. Find the girl. While you can. Come closer and see. See into the dark. Just follow your eyes. Just follow your eyes. I hear her voice. Calling my name. The sound is deep. In the dark. I hear her voice. And start to run. Into the trees. Into the trees. Into the trees. Suddenly I stop. But I know it's too late. I'm lost in a forest. All alone. The girl was never there. It's always the same. I'm running towards nothing. Again and again and again
a japanese dream,I'm going back to the land of the blind. Back to the land where the sun never shines. I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find. Everything just as it was before. I left it all behind. I slept at nights there hysterically. Twisted and turned. But I just couldn't get free. Opened my eyes. But I still couldn't see. But I could feel her. China white girl. So I get down on the floor. Like I am worshipping god. Burning like a monkey. I get down on the floor. Like I am praying to the lord. Burning like a monkey. That was a Japanese dream alright. The sound of the storm. And the flickering light. And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like.... Like her scent used to fill up the night. So I get down on the floor. Like I am worshipping god. Burning like a monkey. I get down on the floor. Like I am praying to the lord. Burning like a monkey. Just look at me now. Just look at me this way. It looks like I am quite insane. It looks like I am trying to eat off my face. It looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway. Back where the sun never shines. Back to the land of the blind. Back in a Japanese dream
a letter to elise,"Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say. I just can't stay here every yesterday. like keep on acting out the same. the way we act out. Every way to smile, forget. And make-believe we never needed. Any more than this. Any more than this. Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do. I know I'll never really get inside of you. to make your eyes catch fire. the way they should. The way the blue could pull me in. If they only would. If they only would. At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else. that hides away. From me and you. there're worlds to part. With aching looks and breaking hearts. And all the prayers your hands can make. Oh I just take as much as you can throw. and then throw it all away. Oh I throw it all away. like throwing faces at the sky. like throwing arms round. Yesterday, I stood and stared. wide-eyed in front of you. And the face I saw looked back. the way I wanted to. But I just can't hold my tears away. the way you do. Elise believe I never wanted this. I thought this time I'd keep. all of my promises. I thought you were the girl always dreamed about. but I let the dream go. and the promises broke. and the make-believe ran out.... Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say. I just can't stay here every yesterday. like keep on acting out the same. the way we act out. every way to smile, forget. and make-believe we never needed. any more than this. any more than this. and every time I try to pick it up. like falling sand. as fast as I pick it up. it runs away through my clutching hands. but there's nothing else I can really do. there's nothing else. I can really do. at all..."

a man inside my mouth,"I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating. I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore. The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic. Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before. I remember one girl standing, one was sitting on the ground. One was holding me up, the other pulling me down. And I couldn't decide which one was real. Because there wasn't a sound, like I was pregnant again. I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating. I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore. The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic. Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before. ""Don't move, don't smile, don't blink, don't even breathe"". And she said, ""Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"". So I was sucking, I was sucking like a fat lady would. But I couldn't hold it down another second. ""Don't twitch, don't shout, don't think, don't even breathe"". She said, ""Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"". So I was sweating, I was sweating like a fat lady would. And I woke up with a man inside my mouth. This won't hurt at all"
a night like this,"Say goodbye on a night like this. If it's the last thing you ever do. You never looked as lost as this. Sometimes it doesn't even look like you. It goes dark it goes darker still please stay. But I watch you like I'm made of stone as you walk away. I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night. A witch hunt for another girl. For always and ever is always for you. You just the most georgeously stupid thing I've ever cursed in the world. Say hello for a day like today, say it every time you move. The way that you look at me now. Makes me wish I was you. It goes deep it goes deeper still. This touch and the smile and the shake of your head and the smile. And the shake of your head. I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night. Can't stand here like this anymore. For always and ever is always for you. I want it to be perfect like before. Oh, I want to change it all. Oh, I want to change. Oh, I want to change it all. Oh, I want to change"
a pink dream,rio sunrise sucking on a straw. i rub my head and stagger out the door. and head into the bright new beautiful day. and the way she pulls me in. sucks my breath away. i asked her for some time. and she just made me it. i asked her maybe why?. and she just gave me it. never smile. never stare. she doesn't seem to care at all. never cry. never scream. she doesn't really seem to need me at all.... fourteen weeks i stay away from home. a hundred days a part of me unknown. apart in pink and perfect moments play. and as a wonder of the world. she sucks my breath away. i asked her for some time. and she just made me it. i asked her maybe why?. and she just gave me it. so i asked her could be heaven?. and she just prayed me it.... she didn't want to know my name. she didn't want to know how long we had together. spending time as if tomorrow never comes. i didn't want to know the end. i didn't want to go but slowly found me home again. and slow again tomorrow comes. but it was all so far away. and so long ago. i hardly ever think about her anymore. except sometimes when the summer twilight breeze. carries me the scent of faraway rain. i remember.... and she still sucks my breath away.
a short term effect,Movement. No movement. Just a falling bird. Cold as it hits the bleeding ground. He lived and died.... Catch sight. Cover me with earth. Draped in black. Static. White sound. A day without substance. A change of thought. An atmosphere that rots with time. Colours that flicker in water. A short term effect. Scream!. As she tries to push him over. Helpless and sick. With teeth of madness. Jump jump dance and sing. Sideways across the desert. A charcoal face. Bites my hand. Time is sweet. Derange and disengage everything. A day without substance. A change of thought. The atmosphere rots with time. Colours that flicker in water. A short term effect. An echo. And a stranger's hand. A short term effect. An echo. And a stranger's hand. A short term effect.
a sign from god,You know I'm sorry if you misunderstood. But your confusion is a bit overdone. I was only in to do it good. I was only in to have some fun. I went out of my way to get this bad. And you still don't get how far. But now I'm back! I'm new!. And it's a wonderful thing. But you still don't get how things are.... Not superstition - I'm talking hideous kinky. No not religion - I'm talking serious oobe. Not science fiction - I'm talking horrible freaky. Yeah all the stuff you don't believe in. Well that stuff is for real. Got myself a change of life. Got myself a change of style. Got myself a new direction. Got myself a reason why. I just fell right out of my face one day. And I took it as a sign from god. And now I'm feeling good. And I'm moving up. And i've got to do it now. Yeah I'm sorry if you misunderstood. But your condition is a touch overplayed. I was only in to do it good. I was only in to get it made. I went way out of my way to get this bad. And you still don't get how far. And now I'm back! I'm new!. And it's a wonderful thing. But you still don't get how things are.... Not superstition - I'm talking hideous kinky. No not religion - I'm talking serious oobe. Not science fiction - I'm talking horrible freaky. Yeah all the stuff you don't imagine. Well it's happening to me. Got myself a change of life. Got myself a change of style. Got myself a new direction. Got myself a reason why. I just fell right out of my face one day. And I took it as a sign from god
a strange day,Give me your eyes. That I might see the blind man kissing my hands. The sun is humming. My head turns to dust as he plays on his knees. And the sand. And the sea grows. I close my eyes. Move slowly through drowning waves. Going away on a strange day. And I laugh as I drift in the wind. Blind. Dancing on a beach of stone. Cherish the faces as they wait for the end. A sudden hush across the water. And we're here again.... And the sand. And the sea grows. I close my eyes. Move slowly through drowning waves. Going away. On a strange day. My head falls backs. And the walls crash down. And the sky. And the impossible. Explode. Held for one moment I remember a song. An impression of sound. Then everything is gone. Forever. A strange day...
a thousand hours,For how much longer can I howl into this wind?. For how much longer. Can I cry like this?. A thousand wasted hours a day. Just to feel my heart for a second. A thousand hours just thrown away. Just to feel my heart for a second. For how much longer can I howl into this wind?
accuracy,"Cherish the moment. Feel inside. We sit in the same room. Side by side. I give you the wrong lines. Feed you. Accuracy, accuracy. Look into my eyes. We both smile. I could kill you. Without trying. That's accuracy. Accuracy. Accuracy. An observant prefers accuracy, accuracy. Practice all day for accuracy. Mirror mirror on the wall..."
adonais,"As he wakes from this bed [as he breaks this spell?], still young and. wistful. out this dream of life and lose us. sleeping stone rack [rat?], blind consumed by phantom pain. and displays of greed. He slips from out this shadow land. and pain where heads grow sorrow grey. and age destroys all hope. and spirits crush the men and hide the world [word?]. The worthless watch the soft sky smile. The breathless hear the roll wind song. like [white?] death in [??] no more [moral?] of life [love?] divine. Dream yourself away, he calls. Eternity awaits us all. Open your eyes and be with me.. be with me... As he breaks the chains, still-young despairs. Hateful shades of treacherous time. Lose a sleeping, torchered mute. devoured by ghosts in shapes of love. Slips through ties of dust. to be the one we dream - he lives up high. if everything we feel. the young and beautiful and brave of heart. The worthless watch the soft sky smile. The breathless hear the roll wind song. like death in [??] no more [moral?] of life [love] divine. Dream yourself away, he calls. Eternity awaits us all. Open your eyes and be with me.. be with me... Dream yourself away, he calls. Eternity awaits us all. Open your eyes and be with me forever.."
all cats are grey,I never thought that I would find myself. In bed amongst the stones. The columns are all men. Begging to crush me. No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes. And no flags wave me home. In the caves. All cats are grey. In the caves. The textures coat my skin. In the death cell. A single note. Rings on and on and on....
all i have to do is kill her,"Pulling this watch as faces go. Pulling in a word and done it slow this other time. I see your face is silent. Oh, we go away and play. What have you done. Takes a feeling inside us all. Continue out with just one push in my mouth. But you're so close now. And you're so close now. All I have to do is three short blows. All that still is best inside. The full when the wall. And you don't even know. And the other faces here with me. The others dressed in summers thing. If only one way is to be beautiful. If only one way is to the other song. And every time it's you, it's like the blood on the stairs is sent away. And every time we see it's all said before you. If only the ways to kill you. You used to say this fear of drowning. Fear no death by water. Father walks in at the foot of the bed. Six of you want to see you safe. Just one time you'll meet this man. All you've got to do is kill her. And all you've got to do is kill her. Trickle the sands against and pull the animals. Just out of the womb. Seeing the cow dead before he was born. It's the man he, he loved. The solid pieces fell on the ground. He couldn't kill another life. He couldn't kill another life. He couldn't kill another life. It's all been painted with love. It could have been some friends. Pulling strings to meet you. All I want to do is reach it. She says 'Let go my shoulder!'. See the sky!. And the sky goes black. And the sky goes black. I just want to feel her. I just want to feel her. I just want you to feel it. I just want you to feel it. Everytime I looked up the stairs. I used to see her die. She would move so slow. Anyone could've been but she was a cat. Anyone could've been she was a cat. Pulling away as I used to fight. That's just playing so low. That ugly or pretty. The face stays the same. Her face stays the same. Her face stays the same. The ugly or pretty. Her face stays the same, stays the same, stays the same. And looking on the final walls. And looking on the final walls. Did you now find this malice out. The angels fall. Let's make some more ('noise'?). Let's make some more ('noise'?). Help me be your mother for just one day. Let's fall in churches far outside. They used to love They used to love..."
all i want,Tonight I'm feeling like an animal. Tonight I'm howling inside. Tonight I'm feeling like an animal. Tonight I'm going wild. And all I want is to be with you again. And all I want is to hold you like a doll. And all I want is to be with you again. With you again. Just to hold you like a doll. Tonight I'm screaming like an animal. Tonight I'm losing control. Tonight I'm screaming like an animal. Tonight I'm getting so low. And all I want is to be with you again. And all I want is to hold you like a doll. And all I want is to be with you again. With you again. Just to hold you like a doll. That's all I want
all kinds of stuff,"So maybe I took too much. Yeah maybe I lost my touch. And maybe all kinds of stuff. Yeah maybe.... Promise me it comes around again. it doesn't matter if it's true. I beg you please don't take away. the only hope I have to [get]. Another go with you and. I will change me back to how I was. before I really understood. the easy way to less is always more.

all of this,With all of this I know now. Everything inside of my head. It all just goes to show how. Nothing I know changes me at all. Again I wait for this to change instead.

anniversary,A year ago today we stood. Above this same awakening world. I held you.... You never wanted me to know. Another year ago today. Before this same awakening world. I held you.... I never meant to let you go. There was a moment. There always is. When time stood still. And always was this.... One endless moment. You turn in pain. And I always let you go. Over and over again.... A year ago tonight we lay. Below this same remembering sky. I kissed you. You never wanted me to know.... Another year ago tonight. Behind this same remembering sky. I kissed you.... I never meant to let you go. Another moment. There always is. As time stands still. and always is this.... One endless moment. You tell me all. And I hold you and I kiss you. And I never let you go. I never let you go...
another day,The sun rises slowly. On another day. The eastern sky grows cold. Winter in water colours. Shades of grey. Something. Something holds me hypnotized.... I stare at the window. Stare at the window. Waiting for the day to go. Winter in water colours. Shades of grey.
apart,"He waits for her to understand. But she won't understand at all. She waits all night for him to call. But he won't call anymore. He waits to hear her say. ""Forgive"". But she justs drops her pearl-black eyes. And prays to hear him say. ""I love you"". But he tells no more lies. He waits for her to sympathize. But she won't sympathize at all. She waits all night to feel his kiss. But always waits alone. He waits to hear her say. ""Forget"". But she just hangs her head in pain. And prays to hear him say. ""No more. I'll never leave again"". How did we get this far apart?. We used to be so close together. How did we get this far apart?. I thought this love would last for ever. He waits for her to understand.

ariel,Golden midnight taking us across the water. (line...sounds vaguely like 'holy love sing we're falling close in every other'). As dawn breaks i wonder. Sun's growing cold. Ours is not to wonder. To never grow old. To never grow old. Oh ariel i (it?) will always feel right out here. (nearly unintelligible line). Sister & brother. Never loved each other like this. (line). And never fall. You never fall. Ariel.
at night,Sunk deep in the night. I sink in the night. Standing alone underneath the sky. I feel the chill of ice. On my face. I watch the hours go by. The hours go by.... You sleep. Sleep in a safe bed. Curled and protected. Protected from sight. Under a safe roof. Deep in your house. Unaware of the changes at night. At night. I hear the darkness breathe. I sense the quiet despair. Listen to the silence. At night. Someone has to be there. Someone has to be there. Someone must be there.
at night (a forest 79 live version),"Silent Night. Speed or sleep. Don't look behind me. Help. Someone's got to watch. It said so in the book. Someone's got to watch. At Night. Sound down there.

babble,Nothing ever changes. Nothing ever moves. I swim around in circles. In the same old lifeless room. And talk about the mirror man. The whispers in my ear again. The hot and sticky pillow man. Is smothering my face again. Nothing ever changes. Nothing ever moves. And I run around hysterical. In dead persistent gloom. And babble out in simile. Like dog-head-monkey-music me. Shut up shut up shut up shut up. Shut up. And let me breathe...

Make you hippa hippa hippa hippa... "". A palace of stones. Of your bananafish bones. I'd buy you a hundred years old. To celebrate our difference. Theorise and talk yourself. Until you're tired and old. Disappear everywhere and watch me. Pull my lips apart. Exploit! Inspire! Encourage!. Be responsible for this.... Ha ha!. I don't think. I don't think. I make use of all this time. Oh kill me kiss me once. And then we'll throw it away. And then we'll throw it away.... Turn off the lights. And tell me about the games you play...."
bare,"if you've got something left to say. you'd better say it now. anything but ""stay"". just say it now. we know we've reached the end. we just don't know how. ""well at least we'll still be friends"". yeah one last useless vow.... ""there are different ways to live"". yeah I know that stuff. ""other ways to give"". yeah all that stuff. but holding onto used to be. is not enough. memory's not life. and it's not love. we should let it all go. it never stays the same. so why does it hurt me like this. when you say that I?ve changed?. When you say that I?ve aged?. Say I?m afraid.... And all the tears you cry. they're not tears for me. regrets about your life. they're not regrets for me. it never turns out how you want. why can't you see?. It all just slips away. it always slips away. eventually.... So if you've got nothing left to say. just say goodbye. turn your face away. and say goodbye. you know we've reached the end. you just don't know why. and you know we can't pretend. after all this time. so just let it all go. nothing ever stays the same. so why does it hurt me like this. to say that I?ve changed?. To say that I?ve aged?. Say I?m afraid.... But there are long long nights when I lay awake. and I think of what I?ve done. of how I?ve thrown my sweetest dreams away. and what I?ve really become. and however hard I try. I will always feel regret. however hard I try. I will never forget. I will never forget"

And I used to sometimes try to catch her. But never even caught her name. And sometimes we would spend the night. Just rolling about on the floor. And I remember even though it felt soft at the time. I always used to wake up sore.... You know I even think that she smiled like you. She used to just stand there and smile. And her eyes would go all sort of far away.

charlotte sometimes,All the faces. All the voices blur. Change to one face. Change to one voice. Prepare yourself for bed. The light seems bright. And glares on white walls. All the sounds of. Charlotte sometimes. Into the night with. Charlotte sometimes. Night after night she lay alone in bed. Her eyes so open to the dark. The streets all looked so strange. They seemed so far away.

Sometimes I'm dreaming. Charlotte sometimes. Sometimes I'm dreaming. Expressionless the trance. Sometimes I'm dreaming. So many different names. Sometimes I'm dreaming. The sounds all stay the same. Sometimes I'm dreaming. She hopes to open shadowed eyes. On a different world. Come to me. Scared princess. Charlotte sometimes. On that bleak track. (See the sun is gone again). The tears were pouring down her face. She was crying and crying for a girl. Who died so many years before.... Sometimes I dream. Where all the other people dance. Sometimes I dream. Charlotte sometimes. Sometimes I dream. The sounds all stay the same. Sometimes I'm dreaming. There are so many different names. Sometimes I dream. Sometimes I dream.... Charlotte sometimes crying for herself. Charlotte sometimes dreams a wall around herself. But it's always with love. With so much love it looks like. Everything else. Of Charlotte sometimes. So far away. Glass sealed and pretty. Charlotte sometimes.

desperate journalist,Hey mister a review. A word for salad. Is written by my friend. In penman. He uses long words. Like semiotics and semolina. But I counted. With. Enigma and metropolis. The lads go rampant on insignificant symbolism. And compound this with rude soulless obliqueness. Everything's coming to a grinding halt. I use such long words. It's all clever stuff. All this charming childish fiddling about aims for the anti-image. But it naturally creates the perfectly malleable image. Tantalizing enigma. Of the Cure. They try to take. Everything. But the Cure really. They're just trying to sell us something. Their product is more artificial than most. This is perhaps part of their. Masterplan. But it seems more like their naivity. Everything's coming to a grinding halt. Everything's coming to a grinding halt. Everything's coming to a grinding halt. Note how really songs what are made of (?). Murk and marshes. Tawdry images. Inane realisations. Dull dull dull epigrams. Sometimes they sound like an avant-garde John Otway. Or an ugly spirit. Toy drumming. Sprightly bass. Limited guitar riff. Check the sheet out of my favorite book. People don't forget the penman. It's just that in 1979 people shouldn't be allowed to get away with things like this. I say..
disintegration,Oh I miss the kiss of treachery. The shameless kiss of vanity. The soft and the black and the velvety. Up tight against the side of me. And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed. And run in thickening streams of greed. As bit by bit it starts the need. To just let go. My party piece. Oh I miss the kiss of treachery. The aching kiss before I feed. The stench of a love for a younger meat. And the sound that it makes. When it cuts in deep. The holding up on bended knees. The addiction of duplicities. As bit by bit it starts the need. To just let go. My party piece. But I never said I would stay to the end. So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency. Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs. Pictures of trickery. Stains on the carpet and. Stains on the scenery. Songs about happiness murmured in dreams. When we both us knew. How the ending would be.... So it's all come back round to breaking apart again. Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round. And it's coming apart again. Over and over and over. Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces. I'll pull out my heart. And I'll feed it to anyone. Crying for sympathy. Crocodiles cry for the love of the crowd. And the three cheers from everyone. Dropping through sky. Through the glass of the roof. Through the roof of your mouth. Through the mouth of your eye. Through the eye of the needle. It's easier for me to get closer to heaven. Than ever feel whole again. I never said I would stay to the end. I knew I would leave you with babies and everything. Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity. Screaming me over and over and over. I leave you with photographs. Pictures of trickery. Stains on the carpet and. Stains on the memory. Songs about happiness murmured in dreams. When we both of us knew. How the end always is. How the end always is....

doubt,Stop my flight to fight. And die. And take a stand to change my life. So savage with red desperation. I clench my hands. You draw your claws. A hidden rage consumes my heart. As fuelled by years of wasted time. I close my eyes. And tense myself. And screaming. Throw myself in fury over the edge. And into your blood. Tear at flesh. And rip at skin. And smash at doubt. I have to break you. Fury drives my vicious blows. I see you fall but still I strike you. Again and again. Your body falls. The movement is sharp and clear and pure. And gone. I stop and kneel beside you. Drained of everything but pain. Screaming throw myself in fury. Over the edge and into your blood. Kiss you once and see you writhe. Hold you close and hear you cry. Kiss your eyes and finish your life. Finish your life. Again and again. Your body falls. The movement is sharp and clear and pure. And gone. I stop and kneel beside you. Knowing I'll murder you again tonight.
down under,"Around the sea green pool we spin. The mermaid singing songs. To pull us in. To swim with him, she slides up slow. To fall down under. Bright burning eyes, the only clue. To who plays, what plays, when plays. You just blew my cue. To drown his tears. For all in wonder. Unlucky start, I smile. But twice is helpless. Fizz down nice, as black with ice. Disguise the stroke. Entice them out. To call their number. Lean in and breathe in. As low as you choose. Remember not all games are won. By the last one to lose.... Her tail I tell his head we break. The trick is how to fake the first mistake. To make them take. The easy choice. Too close to care how. But wet spot sometimes changes stripe. And day to night. If every wrong is right. I dry your eye. You bite my lip. We're almost there now. Lean in and breathe in. As low as you choose. Remember not all games are won"
dredd song,Never say it's over. Never say the end. Anytime you stop just start again. Never say give up. Never say give in. You always have to fight to win. However much it hurts. However much it takes. Belive and all your dreams will all come true. However hard it get's. However much it aches. Always belive in me. As I belive in you. To never say too late. Never say it's done. Make me know for real you are the one. The one that never turns. Never walks away. The one that I can trust to always stay. Always stay..... Never say surrender. Never say die. You only ever get there if you try. Never say give up. Never say give in. You always have to fight to win. However much it hurts. However much it takes. Belive and all your dreams will all come true. However hard it get's. However much it aches. Always belive in me. As I belive in you (x4). Never say if only. Never say regret. Only the weak remember to forget. Never say it's over. Never say the end. Never say never again. However much it hurts. However much it takes. Belive and all your dreams will all come true. However hard it get's. However much it aches. Belive in me. As I belive in you.
dressing up,Going under slowly. It never seems too late. Going under so slow.... Dressing up to kiss. Dressing up to touch all this. I'm dressing up to dance all week. I'm dressing up to sleep. Dressing up to kiss. Dressing up to be all this. I could eat your face. I could eat all of you. Oh this night will never let me go.... Going under slowly. Never seems too late. Going under slowly.... You'll pick me up again.
end,I think I've reached that point. Where giving up and going on. Are both the same dead end to me. Are both the same old song. I think I've reached that point. Where every wish has come true. And tired disguised oblivion. Is everything I do. Please stop loving me. Please stop loving me. I am none of these things. I think I've reached that point. Where all the things you have to say. And hopes for something more from me. Are just games to pass the time away. Please stop loving me. Please stop loving me. I am none of these things. I think I've reached that point. Where every word that you write. Of every blood dark sea. And every soul black night. And every dream you dream me in. And every perfect free from sin. And burning eyes. And hearts on fire. Are just the same old song. Please stop loving me. Please stop loving me. I am none of these things. I am none of these things. I am none of these things
faded smiles (aka i don't know),The bottle top falls to the floor. It rolls in tears. But he cries no more. The sullen pills. Stained through his eyes. He moves his arm against the lies. Tips his head. Swallows his dreams. A silence drowns his final screams. He slides down to the naked tiles. To die alone. With her faded smiles. Tips his head. Swallows his dreams. A silence drowns his final screams. He slides down to the naked tiles. To die alone. With her faded smiles
faith,Catch me if I fall. I'm losing hold. I can't just carry on this way. And every time. I turn away. Lose another blind game. The idea of perfection holds me.... Suddenly I see you change. Everything at once. The same. But the mountain never moves.... Rape me like a child. Christened in blood. Painted like an unknown saint. There's nothing left but hope.... Your voice is dead. And old. And always empty. Trust in me through closing years. Perfect moments wait.... If only we could stay. Please. Say the right words. Or cry like the stone white clown. And stand. Lost forever in a happy crowd.... No-one lifts their hands. No-one lifts their eyes. Justified with empty words. The party just gets better and better.... I went away alone. With nothing left. But faith
fake,"I can't fly I never really could. I don't feel you ever really understood at all. I can't fly I never really could. I just throw my arms out as I fall. Always say you know me, you you dont know me at all. Only want to hold me, but I'm not here to hold. Always say you know me, but you dont know me at all. Only want to show me, but i'm not yours to show, no no no. I Dont dream I never really did. Dont believe you ever really took this into good. No I dont dream I never really did. I just wake up, make up as I should. no i dont dream. no i dont dream. no i dont dream. I wont see I never really would. I dont sense you ever realised it right. No i wont see i never really would.

Only want to show me, but i'm not yours to show. I can't ever come back, If I never go. I don't ever explain, if I never know.

fascination street,Oh it's opening time. Down on Fascination Street. So let's cut the conversation. And get out for a bit. Because I feel it all fading and paling. And I'm begging. To drag you down with me. To kick the last nail in. Yeah! I like you in that. Like I like you to scream. But if you open your mouth. Then I can't be responsible. For quite what goes in. Or to care what comes out. So just pull on your hair. Just pull on your pout. And let's move to the beat. Like we know that it's over. If you slip going under. Slip over my shoulder. So just pull on your face. Just pull on your feet. And let's hit opening time. Down on Fascination Street. So pull on your hair. Pull on your pout. Cut the conversation. Just open your mouth.

fear of ghosts,Like a feeling that I'm down. Down inside my heart. Like I'm looking out through. Splitting bloodred. Windows in my heart. From a higher up than heaven. And a harder down than stone. Shake the fear that always clawing. Pulls me clawing down alone. As I spitting splitting bloodred. Breaking windows in my heart. And the past is taunting. Fear of ghosts. Is forcing me apart. And the further I get. From the things that I care about. The less I care about. How much further away I get.... I am lost again. With everything gone. And more alone. Than I have ever been. I expect you to understand. To feel it too. But I know that even if you will. You cannot ever help me. Nor can I. Ever help you
fight,Sometimes there's nothing to feel. Sometimes there's nothing to hold. Sometimes there's no time to run away. Sometimes you just feel so old. The times it hurts when you cry. The times it hurts just to breathe. And then it seems like there's no-one left. And all you want is to sleep. Fight fight fight. Just push it away. Fight fight fight. Just push it until it breaks. Fight fight fight. Don't cry at the pain. Fight fight fight. Or watch yourself burn again. Fight fight fight. Don't howl like a dog. Fight fight. Just fill up the sky. Fight fight fight. Fight til you drop. Fight fight fight. And never never. Never stop. Fight fight fight. Fight fight fight. So when the hurting starts. And when the nightmares begin. Remember. You can fill up the sky. You don't have to give in. You don't have to give in. Never give in. Never give in. Never give in.
fire in cairo,Slowly fading blue. The eastern hollows catch. The dying sun. Night time follows. Silent and black. Mirror pool mirrors. The lonely place. Where I meet you. See your head. In the fading light. And through the dark. Your eyes shine bright. And burn like fire. Burn like fire in Cairo. Burn like fire. Burn like fire in Cairo. Shifting crimson veil. Silken hips slide. Under my hand. Swollen lips whisper my name. And I yearn. You take me in your arms. And start to burn. F.I.R.E.I.N.C.A.I.R.O. Then the heat disappears. And the mirage. Fades away.... F.I.R.E.I.N.C.A.I.R.O. Burn like a fire in Cairo. Burn like a fire. Blaze like a fire in Cairo. Blaze like a fire. Flare with a wonderful light. Like a fire in Cairo. Burn like fire. Burn like. Fire in Cairo.

from the edge of the deep green sea,"Every time we do this. I fall for her. Wave after wave after wave. It's all for her. ""I know this can't be wrong"" I say. (And I'll lie to keep her happy). ""As long as I know that you know. That today I belong right here with you"". Right here with you.... And so we watch the sun come up. From the edge of the deep green sea. And she listens like her head's on fire. Like she wants to believe in me. So I try. ""Put your hands in the sky. Surrender. Remember. We'll be here forever. And we'll never say goodbye... "". I've never been so. Colourfully-see-through-head before. I've never been so. Wonderfully-me-you-want-some-more. And all I want is to keep it like this. You and me alone. A secret kiss. And don't go home. Don't go away. Don't let this end. Please stay.... Not just for today.... ""Never never never never never let me go"" she says. ""Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"". But suddenly she slows. And looks down at my breaking face. ""Why do you cry?. What did I say?"". ""But it's just rain"" I smile. Brushing my tears away.... I wish I could just stop. I know another moment will break my heart. Too many tears. Too many times. Too many years I've cried over you. How much more can we use it up?. Drink it dry?. Take this drug?. Looking for something forever gone. But something we will always want.... ""Why why why are you letting me go"" she says. ""I feel you pulling back. I feel you changing shape"". And just as I'm breaking free. She hangs herself in front of me. Slips her dress like a flag to the floor. And hands in the sky. Surrenders it all.... I wish I could just stop. I know another moment will break my heart. Too many tears. Too many times. Too many years I've cried for you. It's always the same. Wake up in the rain. Head in pain. Hung in shame. A different name. Same old game. Love in vain. And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles. Away from home again...."
give me it,Get away from me. Get your fingers out of my face. This room's so hot. This room's so hot. I break the walls. Get away from me. Leave me alone. Like the pig on the stairs. Hanging.

Suck your insides. Insides out!. Blood thick swimming round your feet. As you're choking. Choking. Choking on the fleshy words. Give me it give me it give me it. Deaden my glassy mind.

hot hot hot!!!,The first time I saw lightning strike. I saw it underground. Six deep feet below the street. The sky came crashing down. For a second that place was lost in space. Then everything went black. I left that basement burning. And I never went back. The second time I saw it strike. I saw it at sea. It lit up all the fish like rain. And rained them down on me.

how beautiful you are,"you want to know why I hate you. well i'll try and explain. remember that day in paris when we wandered through the rain. and promised to each other. that we'll always think the same. and dreamed that dream to be two souls as one. and stopped just by the sunset. waiting for the night. aside a gliterring building. of glittering glass and burning light. and in the road before us. stood a very grayish man. he held a child upon his back. a small one by the hand. the three of them were dressed in rags. and thinner than air. and all six eyes stared fixedly on you. the father's eyes said ""beautiful! how beautiful you are!"". the boy's eyes said ""how beautiful! she glitters like a star!"". the child's eyes said nothing but a silent utter joy. and made me feel ashame for us at the way we are. i turned to look at you to read your thoughts upon your face. and gazed so deeply into your eyes. so beautiful and strange. till you spoke and showed me understanding is a dream. ""i hate this people staring make them go away from here"". the father's eyes said ""beautiful! how beautiful you are!"". the boy's eyes said ""how beautiful! she glitters like a star!"". the child's eyes said nothing but a mute and utter joy. and filled my heart with sadness for the way we are. and this is why i hate you. and now i understand that no-eve ever knows or loves another. or loves another"

i'm cold,You're begging me to stay. But I'm laughing in your face. You're so desperate. Not to let those years of care. All go to waste. But it was you who wanted love. Not romance. You have to pay the price. My body may be made of fire. But my soul is made of ice. I'm me. I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm told. I'd love to love you girl. But my body. Has just been sold
icing sugar,You're delicious. Dreaming. Slack jawed. Green eyed. Rub my nose in. Icing sugar. Smooth as. When this cold and deadly. Blade. Kisses the fruit. So soft. And gently breathing. Under your skin. Oh I'll empty you. I'll empty you. As empty as a boy can be. As empty. As a boy can be.
if only tonight we could sleep,If only tonight we could sleep. In a bed made of flowers. If only tonight we could fall. In a deathless spell. If only tonight we could slide. Into deep black water. And breathe. And breathe.... Then an angel would come. With burning eyes like stars. And bury us deep. In his velvet arms. And the rain would cry. As our faces slipped away. And the rain would cry. Don't let it end....
in between days,Yesterday I got so old. I felt like I could die. yesterday I got so old. it made me want to cry. go on go on. just walk away. go on go on. your choice is made. go on go on. and disappear. go on go on. away from here. And I know I was wrong. when I said it was true. that it couldn't be me and be her. in between without you. without you. Yesterday I got so scared. I shivered like a child. Yesterday away from you. it froze me deep inside. come back come back. don't walk away. come back come back. come back today. come back come back. why can't you see. come back come back. come back to me. And I know I was wrong. when I said it was true. that it couldn't be me and be her. in between without you. without you. Smith
in your house,I play at night in your house. I live another life. Pretending to swim. In your house. I change the time in your house. The hours I take. Go so slow.... I hear no sound in your house. Silence. In the empty rooms. I drown at night in your house. Pretending to swim....
it used to be me,All he needs is everyone I've been. And all she needs is everywhere i've seen. All they need. Anything i've touched. And all you need is everything i've loved. Everything i've heard everything i've learned. Everything i've tried everything i've held. Everything i've felt everything i've lost. Everything i've cried. Until my whole head shrieks with grinding my teeth. Struggling to find a single word I can keep. Any kind of truth. Any kind of hope. Oh just any kind of word that doesn't make me choke. But I keep saying I will and I won't. I keep saying I do and I don't. I keep saying I feel. But there is nothing to feel. Just a strange kind of nothing where it used to be me.... It used to be me. All he needs from me is everyone i've ever missed. And all she needs from me. Everyone i've ever kissed. All they need from me. Anything i've ever sung. Yeah and all you need from me is everything i've ever said. Everything i've ever done everything i've ever made. Everything i've ever prayed everything i've ever believed. Everything i've ever touched everything i've ever loved. Everything i've ever thought everything i've ever dreamed. Until my whole head screams with grinding my teeth. Desperate to find a single word I can keep. Any kind of faith. Any kind of fix. Oh just any kind of word that doesn't make me sick. And I keep saying I will but I won't. I keep saying I do but I don't. And I keep saying I feel. But there is nothing to feel. Just this strange kind of nothing where it used to be me.... Anything and everything. All that you need. Get it for free. Anything and everything. All that you need. Get it from me. Get it from me. Get it from me. Get it from me
it's not you,You wear your smile. Like it was going out of fashion. Dress to inflame. But douse any ideas of passion. You carry your love in a trinket. Hanging round your throat. Always inviting. Always exciting. But I must not take off my coat. Well I'm tired of hanging around. I want someone new. I'm not sure who I've got in mind. But I know. It's not you. You ask me questions. That I never wanted to hear. I am the only one. Just until you finish this year. I would murder you. If I had an alibi. Here in my hand. But you just laugh. Beause you don't understand. That I'm tired of hanging around. I want somebody new. I'm not sure. Who I've got in mind. But I know that it's not you. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you.
it's over,"I get up. And it's over. It's always over. It's raining and I'm burned. And it's late and you're gone. And I can barely remember. Anything I did or said. Or how I lost another week. There must be something going on.... A nagging sense of shame. I can't explain. An acrid taste of smoke and blood. And tears and drugs. And every inch of me is raw. And it's always fucking over. It's raining and I'm blind. And it's late and you're gone. I can't do this anymore. Keep getting there. It's over. It's always over. It's raining and I'm cracked. And it's late and you're out. And I can't quite remember. Anything I did or said. Or how I lost another year. There must be something coming down.... A sweetly sour unease. It's like a tease. A broken dream of guilt and fear. And spit and steel. And every piece of me in pain. And it's always fucking over. It's raining and it's cold. And it's late and you're out again. Run my head around it. Like I know I really miss her. ""But I always want to do it now"". She told me in a whisper. I try so hard to place it. Wonder why I really feel it. When to send the pretty flowers. Maybe helps her to believe it. Run my tongue along it. Oh the taste is something sicker. ""But you know you have to do it now"". She told me in a whisper. It only takes a second. But the second lasts forever. ""Close your eyes. And let me take you down..."". And I get up. And it's over. It's always fucking over. It's raining and I'm wrecked. And it's late and you're.... No I can't remember. Anything I did or said. Or how I lost another life. I lost another life. I lost another life. I lost another life. Oh I can't do this anymore. No. I can't do this anymore"
jumping someone else's train,Don't say what you mean. You might spoil your face. If you walk in the crowd. You won't leave any trace. It's always the same. You're jumping someone else's train. It won't take you long. To learn the new smile. You have to adapt. Or you'll be out of style. It's always the same. You're jumping someone else's train. If you pick up on it quick. You can say you were there. Again and again and again. You're jumping someone else's train. It's the latest wave. That you've been craving for. The old ideal was getting such a bore. Now you're back in line. Going not quite quite as far. But in half the time. Everyone's happy. They're finally all the same. Because everyone's jumping. Everybody else's train. Jumping someone else's train. Jumping someone else's train. Jumping someone else's train.
jupiter crash,"she follows me down to the sound of the sea. slips to the sand and stares up at me. ""is this how it happens? Is this how it feels?. Is this how a star falls?. Is this how a star falls?"". the night turns as I try to explain. irresistable attraction and orbital plane. ""or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame?"". she brushes my face with her smile. ""forget about stars for a while..."". as she melts.... Meanwhile millions of miles away in space. the incoming comet brushes jupiter's face. and disappears away with barely a trace.... ""was that it? Was that the jupiter show?. It kinda wasn't quite what I?d hoped for you know.... and pulling away she stands up slow. and round her the night turns. round her the night turns.... Yeah that was it. that was the jupiter crash. drawn too close and gone in a flash. just a few bruises in the region of the splash.... She left to the sound of the sea. she just drifted away from me. so much for gravity..."
just like heaven,"Show me, show me, show me. How you do that trick. ""The one that makes me scream,"" she said. ""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said. And threw her arms around my neck. Show me how you do it. And I promise you, I promise that. I'll run away with you. I'll run away with you. Spinning on that dizzy edge. I kissed her face, I kissed her neck. And dreamed of all the different ways. I had to make her glow. ""Why are you so far away,"" she said. ""Why won't you ever know. that I'm in love with you,. That I'm in love with you?"". You... soft and only. You... lost and lonely. You... strange as angels. Dancing in the deepest oceans. Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream. Just like a dream. Daylight whipped me into shape. I must have been asleep for days. And moving lips to breathe her name. I open up my eyes. I find myself alone, alone, alone. Above a raging sea. That stole the only girl I loved. And drowned her deep inside of me.. You... soft and only. You... lost and lonely. You... just like heaven"
just one kiss,I remember the time that you rained all night. The queen of Siam in my arms. Remember the time that the islands sank. But nobody opened their eyes. Remember that time that the trees fell down. The wood crashing through the wall. Remember the sound that could wake the dead. But nobody woke up at all. Somebody died for this. Somebody died for just one kiss. Remember the time that the sky went black. We waited alone on the sands. Remember the taste of the raging sea. But nobody held out their hands. Somebody died for this. Somebody died. For just one kiss. Just one kiss. Just one kiss

killing an arab,Standing on a beach. With a gun in my hand. Staring at the sea. Staring at the sand. Staring down the barrel. At the arab on the ground. See his open mouth. But hear no sound. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab. I can turn and walk away. Or I can fire the gun. Staring at the sky. Staring at the sun. Whichever I choose. It amounts to the same. Absolutely nothing. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab. Feel the steel butt jump. Smooth in my hand. Staring at the sea. Staring at the sand. Staring at myself. Reflected in the eyes of. The dead man on the beach. The dead man. On the beach. I'm alive. I'm dead. I'm the stranger. Killing an arab.
kyoto song,A nightmare of you. Of death in the pool. Wakes me up at quarter to three. I'm lying on the floor of the night before. With a stranger lying next to me. A nightmare of you. Of death in the pool. I see no further now than this dream. The trembling hands of the trembling man. Hold my mouth. To hold in a scream. I try to think. To make it slow. If only here is where I go. If this is real. I have to see. I turn on fire. And next to me.... It looks good!. It tastes like nothing on earth. It looks good!. It tastes like nothing on earth. Its so smooth it even feels like skin. It tells me how it feels to be new. It tells me how it feels to be new. A thousand voices whisper it true. It tells me how it feels to be new. And every voice belongs. Every voice belongs to you.
la ment,Today there was a tragedy. Underneath the bridge. A man walked. Cold and blue. Into La Ment. The sky coloured perfect. As the man slipped away. Waving with a last vanilla smile. Somewhere at a table. Two drowned fools. Smoking. Drinking water as they talked. Of how they loved our lady. And oh the smell as candles die. One more ice cream river body. Flowed underneath the bridge. Underneath the bridge
labirynth,Say it's the same sun spinning in the same sky. Say it's the same stars streaming in the same night. Tell me it's the same world whirling through the same space. Tell me it's the same time tripping through the same day. So say it's the same house and nothing in the house has changed. Yeah say it's the same room and nothing in the room is strange. Oh tell me it's the same boy burning in the same bed. Tell me it's the same blood breaking in the same head. Say it's the same taste taking down the same kiss. Say it's the same you. Say it's the same you and it's always been like this. Say it's the same you. Say it's the same you and it always and forever is. Say it's the same you. Say it's the same you and it's always been like this. Say it's the same you. Say it's the same you and it always and forever is. Say it's the same you. Say it's the same you. Yeah tell me it's all the same. This is how it's always been. But if nothing has changed.... Then it must mean.... But the sun is cold - the sky is wrong. The stars are black - the night is gone. The world is still - the space is stopped. The time is out - the day is dropped. The house is dark - the room is scarred. The boy is stiff - the bed is hard. The blood is thick - the head is burst. The taste is dry - the kiss is thirst. And it's not the same you. It's not the same you. No it never was like this. It's not the same you. It's not the same you and it never really is. It's not the same you. It's not the same you. No it never was like this. It's not the same you. It's not the same you and it never really is. It's not the same you. It's not the same you. Oh it's not the same. This isn't how it's always been. Everything has to have changed.... Or it's me...
lament,Today there was a tragedy. Underneath the bridge. A man lamented. Cold and blue. Into La Ment. The sky coloured perfect. As the man slipped away. Waving with a last vanilla smile. Somewhere at a table. Two drowned fools. Smoking. Drinking water as they talked. Of how they loved our lady. And oh the smell as candles die. One more ice cream river body. Flowed underneath the bridge. Underneath the bridge.
last dance,I'm so glad you came. I'm so glad you remembered. To see how we're ending. Our last dance together. Expectant. Too puctual. But prettier than ever. I really believe that this time it's forever. But older than me now. More constant. More real. And the fur and the mouth and the innocence. Turned to hair and contentment. That hangs in abasement. A woman now standing where once. There was only a girl. I'm so glad you came. I'm so glad you remembered. The walking through walls in the heart of December. The blindness of happiness. Of falling down laughing. And I really believed that this time was forever. But Christmas falls late now. Flatter and colder. And never as bright as when we used to fall. All this in an instant. Before I can kiss you. A woman now standing where once. There was only a girl. I'm so glad you came. I'm so glad you remembered. To see how we're ending. Our last dance together. Reluctantly. Cautiously. But prettier than ever. I really believe that this time it's forever. But Christmas falls late now. Flatter and colder. And never as bright as when we used to fall. And even if we drink. I don't think we would kiss in the way that we did. When the woman. Was only a girl.
let's go to bed,Let me take your hand. I'm shaking like milk. Turning. Turning blue. All over the windows and the floors. Fires outside in the sky. Look as perfect as cats. The two of us together again. But it's just the same. Stupid game. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't say it. If you don't say it first. You think you're tired now. But wait until six.... Laughing at the Christmas lights. You remember. From December. All of this then back again. Another girl. Another name. Stay alive but stay the same. It's just the same. Stupid game. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't play it. If you don't play it first. You can't even see now. So you ask me the way. You wonder if it's true. Because it couldn't be rain.... Through the right doorway. And into the white room. It used to be the dust that would lay here. When I came here alone. But I don't care if you don't. And I don't feel if you don't. And I don't want it if you don't. And I won't say it. If you don't say it first. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Let's go to bed!. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Let's go to bed!
like an animal,one mile in the air that's where she lives. her body looks so thin and pink and small. dropping eggs from nervous shaking hands. and swallowing her fingers as they fall. two people dance on the edge:three of us push them away. there's nowhere to go we're all in this. but nothing can hurt us at all. fight her all you want you'll never win. couldn't we just once leave her in bed. let the dry air cut her happy throat. hide her heart and lose her happy head. first I was a murderer then I was a saint. now I live on stolen time twist and run like paint. like an animal. tuesday in the sun nothing could be worse. not now not ever not anymore.....
like cockatoos,"She walked out of her house. And looked around. At all the gardens that looked. Back at her house. (Like all the faces. That quiz when you smile...). And he was standing. At the corner. Where the road turned dark. A part of shiny wet. Like blood the rain fell. Black down on the street. And kissed his feet she fell. Her head an inch away from heaven. And her face pressed tight. And all around the night sang out. Like cockatoos. ""There are a thousand things"" he said. ""I'll never say those things to you again"". And turning on his heel. He left a trace of bubbles. Bleeding in his stead. And in her head. A picture of a boy who left her. Lonely in the rain. (And all around the night sang out. Like cockatoos)."
looking-glass-girl,"Like a looking Glass girl. in a minature world. saw you dance like dice. and tumble to the floor. like a looking Glass girl. in a minature world. whirl your disney arms. and jump the merry-go-round. The Umbrella man is shouting. We shake his paper hands. there's mirrors down beneath. our feet so ""Let's skate Down. the street"" The Casino man is. laughing he wears a shivering hat. We peel away like tinsel. Stick like splinters to the wall. Like a looking glass girl. In a minature world. She saw you dressed in rags. In-and-out of a jack-in-a-box. because she's a looking glass girl. in a minature world. whirl your see-saw-arms. and ride the catherine wheel. (foot, foot)."
lost,I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. In the head of this stranger in love. Holding on given up. To another under faded setting sun. And I wonder where I am.... Could she run away with him?. So happy and so young. And I stare. As I sing in the lost voice of a stranger in love. Out of time letting go. In another world that spins around for fun. And I wonder where I am.... Could he ever ask her why?. So happy and so young.... And I stare... But.... I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. In the heart of this stranger in love. Given up holding on. To this other under faded setting sun. And I'm not sure where I am.... Would he really turn away?. So happy and so young.... And I stare.... As I play out the passion of a stranger in love. Letting go of the time. In this other world that spins around for one. And I'm not sure where I am.... Would she know it was a lie?. So happy and so young.... And I stare... But.... I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. In the soul of this stranger in love. No control over one. To the other under faded setting sun. And I don't know where I am.... Should he beg her to forgive?. So happy and so young.... And I stare.... As I live out the story of a stranger in love. Waking up going on. In the other world that spins around undone. And I don't know where I am.... Should she really say goodbye?. So happy and so young. And I stare... But.... I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I can't find myself. I got lost in someone else.

lullaby,"On candystripe legs the spiderman comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. and suddenly. A movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do. When I realise with fright. That the spiderman is having me. for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now. Closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me. and his tongue in my eyes. ""Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy"". Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"". And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning I will wake up. In the shivering cold. And the spiderman is always hungry..."
m,Hello image. Sing me a line from your favourite song. Twist and turn. But you're trapped in the light. All the directions were wrong. You'll fall in love with somebody else. Tonight. Help yourself. But tell me the words. Before you fade away. You reveal all the secrets. To remember the end. And escape someday. You'll fall in love with somebody else. Again tonight. Take a step. You move in time. But it's always back .... The reasons are clear. Your face is drawn. And ready for the next attack
man inside my mouth,"I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating. I was wrapped up in a blanket. I was grey. Damp and sore. The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic. (Like I think I'm at the racing. Like the night before). I remember one girl standing. One was sitting on the ground. One was holding me up. The other pulling me down. And I couldn't decide which one was real. Because there wasn't a sound. (Like I was pregnant again...). ""Don't move don't blink don't even breathe"" she said. ""Or the photograph will spoil. And cut you off at the head"". So I was sucking. I was suncking like a fat lady would. But I couldn't hold it down another second. ""Don't twitch don't shout don't think don't even breathe"" she said. ""Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"". So I was sweating. I was sweating like a fat lady would. And I woke up. With a man inside my mouth. (This won't hurt at all)"
maybe someday,"No I won't do it again, I don't want to pretend. If it can't be like before I've got to let it end. I don't want what I was, I had a change of head. But maybe someday.... Yeah maybe someday. I've got to let it go and leave it gone. Just walk away, stop it going on. Get too scared to jump if I wait too long. But maybe someday.... I'll see you smile as you call my name. Start to feel, and it feels the same. And I know that maybe someday's come. Maybe someday's come.... Again!. So tell me someday's come tell me some days come again.... No I won't do it some more, doesn't make any sense. If it can't be like it was, i've got to let it rest. I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense. But maybe someday.... I'll see you smile as you call my name. Start to feel, and it feels the same. And I know that maybe someday's come. Maybe someday's come.... If I could do it again maybe just once more. Think I could make it work like I did it before. If I could try it out. If I could just be sure. That maybe someday is the last time. Yeah maybe someday is the end. Oh maybe someday is when it all stops. Or maybe someday always comes again..."

mouth to mouth,Your body grows more beautiful. with every move you make. Your body grows more beautiful. with every bite I take. You won't believe I love you. it's too stupid for words. So I lick your trembling lips. and use your hands to feed the birds. I laid with you for hours. staring at your face. I laid with you for hours. remembering your taste. And when the morning came. it splattered us in light. I think I left you sleeping there. I think I left you sleeping. Mouth to Mouth - I asked you to stay. Mouth to Mouth - but you're slipping away. Down seven stairs and first on the left. Arch your back and hold your breath. A million fat girls and a million fat man. Couldn't put me back together again..

new day,New day. In heaven the ground is waiting. For the dust. The seed. My love once more. I shout. New day. Hold the air and gasp in life. This solid dance. This cold cold night. Is gone. The dark heat throbs. The fools sweat swims. The hazy light. The deadly sins. Are gone. Crack the stone. Invade my head. Dropping honey dropping dead again. The silence shouts. Across the gap. Another dreaming. Love me again. Shout
numb,"Yeah this is how it ends after all these years, tired of it all. Hopelessly, helplessly broken apart, he finally falls. He doesn't want to think, doesn't want to feel. Doesn't want to know what's going on. Says there's nothing he can do will change anything. He doesn't want to know what's going wrong. Because he's in love with a drug. One that makes him numb. One that stops him feeling at all. He's in love with a drug, forget everyone. He really doesn't care anymore, anymore. Yeah this is how it ends after all this time, everything just fades away. Wornout and empty and all alone, with nothing left to say. Oh it's all too big to make a difference, it's all too wrong to make it right. Yeah everything is too unfair, everything too much to bear. He doesn't have the strength left for the fight. Says all he wants is the drug. The one that makes him numb. The one that stops him feeling at all. He just wants to take the drug, forget everyone. He doesn't want to care anymore. Just keeps loving the drug. The one that makes him numb. The one that stops him feeling at all. Just keeps loving the drug. The drug that he's become. He isn't really here anymore. And that makes me cry"

one hundred years,"It doesn't matter if we all die. Ambition in the back of a black car. In a high building there is so much to do. Going home time, a story on the radio. Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh. A prayer for something better, a prayer for something better. Please love me, meet my mother, but the fear takes hold. Creeping up the stairs in the dark. Waiting for the death blow. Waiting for the death blow. Waiting for the death blow. Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot. Fighting for freedom on the television. Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs. Have we got everything? She struggles to get away. The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl. Waiting for Saturday the death of her father pushing her. Pushing her white face into the mirror. Aching inside me and turn me round. Just like the old days. Just like the old days. Just like the old days. Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face. Just a piece of new meat in a clean room. The soldiers close in under a yellow moon. All shadows and deliverance under a black flag. A hundred years of blood crimson. The ribbon tightens round my throat. I open my mouth and my head bursts open. A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water. Thrashing in the water. Over and over we die one after the other. Over and over we die one after the other. After the other. After the other. After the other. After the other. After the other. It feels like a hundred years. One hundred years. One hundred years. One hundred years. One hundred years"

Take me in your arms tonight. Hold me. Hold me up so high. And never let me down. Hold me. Hold me up so high. To touch the sky. Just one more time. Take me in your arms tonight. Take me in your arms. Just one more time. Just one more time. Just one more time.

I have to say we do. And i promise in less than than an hour we will honestly go.... Now why don't I just get you another. While you just say hello... "". Yeah just say hello.... So I'm clutching it tight. Another glass in my hand. And my mouth and the smiles. Moving up as I stand up. Too close and too wide. And the smiles are too bright. And I breathe in too deep. And my head's getting light. But the air is getting heavier and it's closer. And I'm starting to sway. And the hands all on my shoulders don't have names. And they won't go away. So here I go. Here I go again.... Falling into strangers. And it's only just eleven. And I'm staring like a child. Until someone slips me heaven. And I take it on my knees. Just like a thousand times before. And I get transfixed. That fixed. And I'm just looking at the floor. Just looking at the floor. Yeah i look at the floor.... And I'm starting to laugh. Like an animal in pain. And I've got blood on my hands. And I've got hands in my brain. And the first short retch. Leaves me gasping for more. And I stagger over screaming. On my way to the floor. And I'm back on my back. With the lights and the lies in my eyes. And the colour and the music's too loud. And my head's all the wrong size. So here I go. Here I go again.... Yeah I laugh and I jump. And I sing and I laugh. And I dance and I laugh. And I laugh and I laugh. And I can't seem to think. Where this is. Who I am. Why I'm keeping this going. Keep pouring it out. Keep pouring it down. Keeping it going. Keep pouring it down. And the way the rain comes down hard.... That's the way I feel inside.... I can't take it anymore. This it I've become. This is it like I get. When my life's going numb. I just keep moving my mouth. I just keep moving my feet. I say I'm loving you to death. Like I'm losing my breath. And all the smiles that I wear. And all the games that I play. And all the drinks that I mix. And I drink until I'm sick. And all the faces I make. And all the shapes that I throw. And alll the people I meet. And all the words that I know. Makes me sick to the heart. Oh I feel so tired.... And the way the rain comes down hard.... That's how I feel inside...."
orgy,"A disease is under my fingernails. it stains me like a tattoo. Back on the Rack. aching w/ time. your face is familiar. from another crime. and we could swim, we could swim. my little fishes and me. Overgrown senses prickle + spark. the flesh is in the palm of my hand. Back on the Rack. love under will. your face is familiar. from another kill. A tongue explodes into my mouth. a taste of coma and tears. Back on the Rack. my shape of rage. your face is familiar. from another cage. and we could swim...."
other voices,Whisper your name in an empty room. You brush past my skin. As soft as fur. Taking hold. I taste your scent. Distant noises. Other voices. Pounding in my broken head. Commit the sin. Commit yourself. And all the other voices said. Change your mind. You're always wrong. Come around at Christmas. I really have to see you. Smile at me slyly. Another festive compromise. But I live with desertion. And eight million people. Distant noises. Other voices. Pulsing in my swinging arms. Caress the sound. So many dead. And all the other voices said. Change your mind. You're always wrong.
out of mind,I've been up for days. And I feel like a menagerie. I'm scratching 'til I bleed. And I keep on seeing. Imaginary lemurs. In the street. In the middle of the day. But as long as I can breathe. Then I know I'll be OK. I'll be alright. I'm out of mind. I'm out of sight. I'm out of sight. I've been up for days. And I feel like a laboratory rat. Inside a maze. And I reel in the monotony of. Screaming. At the moon. In the middle of the day. But as long as I can see it. Then I know I'll be ok. I'll be fine. I'm out of sight. I'm completely out of mind. Completely out of mind. OK. Alright. Come and watch me shake tonight. Mouth wide. Soft and bright. Bite my hand and scream. OK. Alright. Come and watch me break tonight. Push deep. Out of sight. Bite my hand and hold on tight

perfect murder,move inside my daydream. like fingers in a glove. twisting round and round and round. round and round and round with love!. the meeker sleeker circle girls dressed in docile white. spinning on a hill they follow the dracula kite. the first idea flew thin and uninvited from the sky. I reached out my hands and held the knife of ice. very thin red water flowed underneath my skin. I turned their eyes blue children. the perfect murder. wait until the darkest coldest summer nights. thats when it starts. but if you blink you'll miss the fun. you'll lose their pretty hearts
pictures of you,I've been looking so long at these pictures of you. That I almost believe that they're real. I've been living so long with my pictures of you. That I almost believe that the pictures. are all I can feel. Remembering you standing quiet in the rain. As I ran to your heart to be near. And we kissed as the sky fell in. Holding you close. how I always held close in your fear. remembering you. Running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow. And screamed at the make-believe. Screamed at the sky. And you finally found all your courage to let it all go. Remembering you fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of you heart. You were stone white. So delicate. So lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. Remembering you. How you used to be slow drowned. You were angels so much more than everything. Oh hold for the last time then slip away. Quietly open my eyes. But I never see anything. If only i'd thought of the right words. I could have held onto your heart. If only i'd thought of the right words. I wouldn't be breaking apart all my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you. But I never hold onto your heart. Looking so long for the words to be true. But always just breaking apart my pictures of you. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to feel you deep in my heart. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to never feel the breaking apart all my pictures of you
piggy in the mirror,Shapes in the drink like Christ. Cracks in the pale blue wall. I'm walking slowly and quickly but. Always away. Twisting twisting to the floor. Flowers in your mouth and the same dry song. The routine from laughter land. Sixteen white legs and a row of teeth. They watch you in secrecy. You're dying for the hope is gone. From here we go nowhere again. I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing. Too much. I can't climb out the way I fell in. Jump with me. For that old forgotten dance. The midnight sun will burn you up. Your life is cold. Your life is hard. Your life is too much for words. These occasions are such a relief. Another point another view to send. Hey hey hey!. We start to talk. And it's all so safe.... I feed you in my dreams. Footsteps on a wire. High above my head. The stain reveals my real intention. I'm the waiting beast. I'm the twisted nerve. As I dance. Dance back to the body in my bed. Look at the piggy. Piggy in the mirror.
pillbox tales,Electric line. Racing time. Fire down the wall. Spinning around. The killing ground. It makes you look so small. Henna years. The stinging tears. Flesh on the railway track. The screaming queen. On the TV screen. Is never coming back. Don't suffer no more. Just step inside and listen. Listen to my pillbox tales. Your special days. Your winning ways. You're living out the past. You're lying lies. And tying ties. And running much too fast. But you feel so sick. If you run too quick. And wishing every day. Wishing you were years away. Don't suffer no more. Just step inside and listen. Listen to my pillbox tales
plainsong,"""I think it's dark and it looks like rain"". You said. ""And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world"". You said. ""And it's so cold. It's like the cold if you were dead"". And then you smiled. For a second. ""I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain"". You said. ""And it's all running out like it's the end of the world"". You said. ""And it's so cold it's like the cold if you were dead"". And then you smiled. For a second. Sometimes you make me feel. Like I'm living at the edge of the world. Like I'm living at the edge of the world. ""It's just the way I smile"". You said"

play for today,It's not a case of doing what's right. It's just the way I feel that matters. Tell me I'm wrong. I don't really care. It's not a case of share and share alike. I take what I require. I don't understand.... You say it's not fair. You expect me to act. Like a lover. Consider my moves. And deserve the reward. To hold you in my arms. And wait.... For something to happen. It's not a case of telling the truth. Some lines just fit the situation. You call me a liar. You would anyway. It's not a case of aiming to please. You know you're always crying. It's just your part. In the play for today.

pornography,A hand in my mouth. A life spills into the flowers. We all look so perfect. As we all fall down. In an electric glare. The old man cracks with age. She found his last picture. In the ashes of the fire. An image of the queen. Echoes round the sweating bed. Sour yellow sounds inside my head. In books. And films. And in life. And in heaven. The sound of slaughter. As your body turns. But it's too late. One more day like today and I'll kill you. A desire for flesh. And real blood. I'll watch you drown in the shower. Pushing my life through your open eyes. I must fight this sickness. Find a cure. I must fight this sickness....
possession,The other one feeds on my hesitation. Grows inside of my trepidaton. Buries his claws in my dislocation. I whisper your name to lose control. I take a step and over my shoulder. His roll-white eyes shine wilder and bolder. His snow-white thighs press closer and colder. Murmer in me to let him go. The other one thrives on my desperation. Fills me up with my intoxication. Sinks his teeth in my deviation. Suffering me to lose control. Hold my mouth taste his breath. Hissing breathing are the same. Snakes its sound inside my head. Sickening me to let him go. To let him go. I take a step and over my shoulder. His pain-white eyes shine wilder and bolder. His stain-white thighs press closer and colder. Murdering me to let him go. I try to resist the gruesome kiss. I twist to deny the blood-hot bliss. But I always feel myself becoming him. And the last thing I remember. It isn't me -- it isn't me -- it isn't me. But then it never is...
prayers for rain,You shatter me. Your grip on me. A hold on me. So dull it kills. You stifle me. Infectious sense. Of hopelessness and. Prayers for rain. I suffocate. I breathe in dirt. And nowhere shines. But desolate. And drab the hours all spent. On killing time again. All waiting for. The rain. You fracture me. Your hands on me. A touch so plain. So stale it kills. You strangle me. Entangle me. In hopelessness and. Prayers for rain. I deteriorate. I live in dirt. And nowhere glows. But drearily and tired. The hours all spent. On killing time again. All waiting for. The rain.
primary,The innocence of sleeping children. Dressed in white. And slowly dreaming. Stops all time. I slow my steps and start to blur. So many years have filled my heart. I never thought I'd say those words. The further we go. And older we grow. The more we know. The less we show. The very first time I saw your face. I thought of a song. And quickly changed the tune. The very first time I touched your skin. I thought of a story. And rushed to reach the end. Too soon. Oh remember. Oh please. Don't change. And so the fall came. Thirteen years. A shiny ring. And how I could forget your name. The air no longer in my throat. Another perfect lie is choked. But it always feels the same. So they close together. Dressed in red and yellow. Innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms. Still dream...
punish me with kisses,your morning smile of torture holds me in it's grip. you trace the taste of yesterday the bruise upon my Lip. you touch my eyes and hypnotize and slip inside my heart. I wait for this forever but we always fall apart. you want to hold me closer. and secretly entice. you take the size of shadowed men. and punish me with kisses every night. this espionage is sweeter now. now that we're alone but I meet your eyes and then despise. all we call our own. I write my name in lipstick on the mirror as I leave. to stay would be too dangerous. to break the make believe...

I’m really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss. maybe it's the sex with the drugs and the fools. or maybe it's the promise of belief?.

When I scream and shout the way I do. Is I don't know I really don't. Just the same as you. Just the same as you. You know those things I said. All those things that made you run away from me. I didn't really mean a word. I didn't really mean I don't believe. All I ever really mean. When I rant and rave the way I do. Is I'm scared again. Just as scared as you. Sometimes it's so hard. To just throw it all away. Sometimes it's so hard. You could just throw it all away. And all those things I said. All those things that made you cry. I didn't really mean that stuff. I didn't really mean to say goodbye. Didn't really mean to say goodbye. You know those things I said. All those things that made you run away from me. I didn't mean a word.

screw,When you screw up your eyes. When you screw up your face. When you throw out your arms. And keep changing your shape. Taste the taste in your mouth. Taste the taste on your tongue. On the film on your eyes of what I've become. What do I do when you screw up your eyes?. What do I do when you screw up your face?. What do I do. When you throw out your arms. Fall on the floor. And keep changing your shape?. Jump right into your mouth?. Jump around on your tongue?. And the film on your eyes of the way I've become. Makes me sick at the way that I try. Anything in the world. To impress that I'm doing this. Only for you.
secrets,Secrets. Share with another girl. Talking all night in a room. All night. Everything slowing down. I wish I was yours.... Strangers. Nobody knows we love. I catch your eyes in the dark. One look relives the memory. Remember me. The way I used to be.
see the children,I stopped the car the other day. I had to ask a little girl the way. I thought she'd show me better if she got inside. And once inside I thought I'd take her for a little ride. So I see the children feel the children. See the children feel the children all the time. See the children feel the children. See the children feel the children all the time. I'm the supermarket santa underneath the Christmas tree. The little ones all like to come sit upon my knee. I have to hold them tightly cause they fall to the floor. A little concern. It's against the law. So I see the children feel the children. See the children feel the children all the time. See the children blush and uhh.... ...All the time. I pass by the infant school every single day. I push sweeties through the fence but the kids just run away. I only want to talk with them and join in thier fun. But all the little children knew to. Run run run run run run run...
seventeen seconds,Time slips away. And the light begins to fade. And everything is quiet now. Feeling is gone. And the picture disappears. And everything is cold now. The dream had to end. The wish never came true. And the girl. Starts to sing. Seventeen seconds. A measure of life. Seventeen seconds.
sex-eye-make-up,Run around the chairs in your sunday dress. It's the best thing money can buy. or leave me on the stairs with my feet in the air. I think that I'm Jazzy like Christ. one more cigarette and the car burns slow. burning like the body Waiting at home. throw out your teeth and call all your friends. someone coughing took away my breath. inches of glass all shiny and new screaming laughing-. fucks me to death one more boy full of writing white mice. rolls over again in a london disguise. the blood bath woman in room number one. sex-eye-make-up tonight she just woke up today to do as she's told. do you want to touch her?.
shake dog shake,Ha ha ha!!!. Wake up in the dark. The aftertaste of anger in the back of my mouth. Spit it on the wall. And cough some more. And scrape my skin with razor blades. And make up in the new blood. And try to look so good. Follow me!. Make up in the new blood. And follow me to where the real fun is. Ha ha ha!!!. As stale and selfish as a sick dog. Spurning sex like an animal of god. I'll tear your red hair by the roots. And hold you blazing. Hold you cherished in the dead electric light. Your face. I'll never see you this way again. I captured it so perfectly. As if I knew you'd disappear away. Shake dog shake. You hit me again. You howl and hit me again. The same sharp pain. Wakes me in the dark. And cuts me from my throat to my pounding heart. My heart. My shaking heart. Shake dog shake. But we slept all night in the virgin's bed. And dreamed of death. And breathed like sick dogs. We slept all night in the virgin's bed. And breathed like death. And dreamed of sick dogs. Shake dog shake. Wake up wake up wake up!. Shake dog shake. Wake up wake up wake up!. Shake dog shake. Wake up in the new blood. Make up in the new blood. Shake up in the new blood. And follow me to where the real fun is.... Shake dog shake
shiver and shake,You're just a waste of time. You're just a babbling face. You're just three sick holes that run like sores. You're a fucking waste. You're like a slug on the floor. Oh! you're useless and ugly. And useless and ugly. And I shiver and shake. When I think of how you make me hate. I want to smash you to pieces. I want to smash you up and screaming. I want to smash you helpless. Down on the floor. Smash you until you're not here anymore. And I shiver and shake. Shiver and shake.
siamese twins,I chose an eternity of this. Like falling angels. The world disappeared. Laughing into the fire. Is it always like this?. Flesh and blood and the first kiss. The first colours. The first kiss. We writhed under a red light. Voodoo smile. Siamese twins. A girl at the window looks at me for an hour. Then everything falls apart. Broken inside me. It falls apart. The walls and the ceiling move in time. Push a blade into my hands. Slowly up the stairs. And into the room. Is it always like this?. Dancing in my pocket. Worms eat my skin. She glows and grows. With arms outstretched. Her legs around me.... In the morning I cried. Leave me to die. You won't remember my voice. I walked away and grew old. You never talk. We never smile. I scream. You're nothing. I don't need you any more. You're nothing. It fades and spins. Fades and spins.... Sing out loud. We all die!!!. Laughing into the fire.... Is it always like this?.
signal to noise,Nothing I do makes much sense. Say you don't really get me anymore. I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?. Nothing I want means a lot. Say you don't understand me like before. I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?. Nothing I think has a point. Say you don't quite believe me anymore. I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?. Gets hard to guess the best way through. The thing to do if none of this is true. I wish I knew how to undo. The doubt I hide inside. I grew in you.... The knot I hide inside I tied in you.... Nothing I am shows the way. Say you don't seem to know me like before. I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?. No nothing I do makes much sense. Say you don't really get me anymore. I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?. Gets hard to guess the best way through. The thing to do if none of this is true. I wish I knew how to undo. The knot I tied in you.... When more or less the yes and no. Is all for show it isn't really so.... Look high and low where did we go?. You moved too fast or maybe I just moved too slow?. There's so much noise.... All the signal seems to fade away. Too much noise.... Or could be this is how it always sounds. With nothing left?
sinking,I am slowing down. As the years go by. I am sinking. So I trick myself. Like everybody else. The secrets I hide. Twist me inside. They make me weaker. So I trick myself. Like everybody else. I crouch in fear and wait. I'll never feel again.... If only I could remember. Anything at all.
sirensong,"It could have been her golden hair. That turned my head. I didn't look to stare. Like I was hypnotized. But I was fixed. On how she pointed slowly down. And low I sank. And still without a sound. The world was far away. And I was tricked. It could have been her silver skin. That drew me on. I didn't mean to spin. Like I was mesmerised. But I was rapt. Without a name or memory. I waited there. Too scared to even breathe.... She sang...she sang...she sang.... She sang. ""Tell me you love me. And beg me to stay"". She Sang. ""Tell me you love me. before it's too late"". She sang. ""Give me your life. Or I must fly away. And you will never hear this song again"". It could have been her crystal eyes. That made me stop. I didn't want to sigh. Like I was stupefied. But I was thrown. And at that point of no return. My whole life hanging. On a single word. To be hers evermore. Or mine alone. She sang...she sang...she sang.... She sang. ""Tell me you love me. And beg me to stay"". She Sang. ""Tell me you love me. before it's too late"". She sang. ""Give me your life. Or I must fly away. And you will never hear this song..."""
six different ways,"This is stranger than I thought. Six different ways inside my heart. And every one I'll keep tonight. Six different ways go deep inside. I'll tell them anything at all. I know I'll give them more and more. I'll tell them anything at all. I know I'll give the world and more. They think I'm on my hands and head. This time they're much too slow. Six sides to every lie I say. It's that American voice again. ""It was never quite like this before. Not one of you is the same... "". This is stranger than I thought. Six different ways inside my heart. And everyone I'll keep tonight. Six different ways go deep inside."
sleep when i'm dead,"""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. But until then..."". They told me I would live forever. If I kept it clean. They said I would be the chosen one. If I took one for the team. Yeah it's the only way to be. Never think it isn't fair. That's a green-eyed panic climb. To the edge of nowhere. Give it to the chicken. And see if it ticks. Yeah, give it to the kitten. See if it sicks. Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me. And I will tell on my return the way it is. with all the happy boys and girls. Yeah the whole h-h-happy world. And the love they feel for me. Yeah the love they feel for me. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. They told me I could run the world. If I kept it quiet. They said I could be the man. If I took it out of sight. In a monkey suit again. Having fun with all your friends. How a casual hour can pull. All this world to pieces. Give it to the bunny. And see if she kicks. Yeah, give it to the puppy. And see if he sticks. Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me. I'll let you know when I get back, just how it is. with all the other boys and girls. Yeah the whole f...f... other world. And the way it stirs inside. And the why it never burns at night. And the way they make the climb. And the why they never pray for time. And the way I show surprise. And the why I never close my eyes. Yeah, just how it is. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead"", I said. ""Sleep when I'm dead, you angels. I'll sleep when I'm dead. But until then..."". Well...I should at least feel tired, I think. Before I lay me down to dream"
snakepit,Well we're a mile under the ground. And I'm thinking that it's Christmas. And I'm kissing you hard. Like I've got very important business. And no-one knows. And no-one sees us. Because they're drinking their selves senseless. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing in the snakepit. Well I'm out in a car. And it's just full of stupid girls. And I've forgotten how to speak. And I just can't remember a word. And my eyes feel like they're bursting. And they're splitting like plums. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing in the snake pit
snow in summer,High up on this mountain. The whole world looks so small. And all the rivers. Run away. Slipping in your deep green heart. I drink you as I swim. And I'm sliding.

And close in me. Just like the snow in summer. Just like the snow in summer. As it melts. Into the sea

speak my language,It was only yesterday. Waving arms across the street. Your white face left me blue. How can I say all the things. I have to say to you. Oh all the people here. All look the same. The little time I spend with you. We drink each other dry. Chorus:. Mammnnarghaassstmmetc. Speak my language. It was only yesterday. My eyes touched yours across the street. We cut the words. And waved goodbye. And dropped off the edge of the world. (chorus)
spilt milk,"I don't think I ever know if I really want it. Could be why I'm never sure if I ever really got it. And I guess it's maybe easier not to think too much about it.... A house a car a family and friends. Yeah, it all means to justify the ends. But sometimes...I wonder...in the back of my mind. Sometimes...I wonder...if I'm wasting all my time. Sometimes...I wonder...if I'm putting off my real life.... What I could've done, where I could've been. When I should've gone, when I should've seen. Who I would've loved, how I would've dreamed. And if it's always always too late.... I don't think I ever know that I ever really need it. Could be why I'm never sure that I ever really feel it. And I think it's maybe easier to guess I really mean it.... A house! A car! A family and friends!. Yeah, all it means to justify the ends. But sometimes...I wonder.... A girl! A smile! A holiday and sex!. Yeah, all it takes to make sense of the rest. But sometimes...I wonder...in the back of my mind. Sometimes...I wonder...if I'm killing all my time. Sometimes...I wonder...if I'm giving up my real life.... What I could've done, where I could've been. When I should've gone, why I should've seen. Who I would've loved, how I would've dreamed. And if it's always always too late.... And every day that I let slide. Is one more day I never try. To break the world. To make my fate. And with every day that I let go. It's one day less I never know. If it's always. Always too late...."
splintered in her head,Shape is still. Asleep. With the toys. As tall as men. The pictures in the hallway. Turning inside. Whispers. Unseen. Jumping against the sky. Slipping away. He looks. For the last time...
stop dead,Let me forget. let me forget. Or let me go let me go. I'll keep it quiet as a whisper. I'll keep it low low low. Never. The biggest word I ever heard. Stop dead. Stop dead. You're getting too close. Before you even opened your eyes. I moved about a million ways. I killed about a million people. And filled about half a day. Before you even opened your eyes. You had to have to ask me who. I love it. I mean you. My face was in your hands. You looked into my eyes. You said I tasted right. And swallowed me alive
strange attraction,"It started with a dedication. ""lost in admiration - happy birthday - I’m forever yours -blossom"". faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies. I smiled surprised at how when flickered through. the wings flew by spelled out my name.... Six months went by the summer lost. obsessively the letters dropped into my life. the same soft blood smooth flowing hand. ""please try to understand - I have to see you - have to feel you-. tell you all the ways I need you - yours forever in love... "". strange attraction spreads it's wings. it varies but the smallest things. you never know how anything will change. strange attraction spreads it's wings. and alters but the smallest things. you never know how anything will fade. the year grew old incessantly she wrote to me. she'd started smoking poetry!. I laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase. she'd pulled me in.... I answered her. a christmas card in sepia. arranging when and where. and how the two of us should meet.... Her opening so well prepared. a nervous smile. I couldn't take my eyes from her. she whispered. ""can I use some of your lipstick?"". it was perfect so believable. I couldn't help but feel that it was real. and kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms.... Strange attraction spreads it's wings. it varies but the smallest things. you never know how anything will change. strange attraction spreads it's wings. and alters but the smallest things. you never know how anything will fade. so alone into the cold new year without another word from her. I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring. but weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthdaycame. and with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same.... ""I’m sorry - blame infatuation - blame imagination -. I was sure you'd be the one but I was wrong -. it seems reality destroys our dreams - I won't forget you -blossom"". faded red inside a tiny book of old goodbyes.... Strange attraction spreads it's wings. it varies but the smallest things. you never know how anything will change. strange attraction spreads it's wings. and alters but the smallest things. and you never know..."
subway song,Midnight in the subway. She's on her way home. She tries hard not to run. But she feels she's not alone. Echoes of footsteps. Follow close behind. But she dare not turn around.... Turn around....
sugar girl,Oh I wish I could find it funny. You laughing like that. But instead I change into a rage. And run around. Without a face. I wish I could find it funny. When you never came back. But I don't suppose I'll ever know. The how to keep you. Goodbye sugar girl. Goodbye sugar girl
switch,"Sometime it seems. I stop being myself. And without a word. Turned into somebody else. Full of wishes want dreams. And desires. For a life. Of conceit and deceit. And repeat and rewrite. Not sure who I was. Before this me and I changed. But I know this me now. Is not really the same.... Friends are as strangers. And strangers as friends. And I feel like I'm wired in a why. Yeah my friends are as strangers. And strangers as friends. And I feel like I'm lost in a lie. And every day my world gets slower. and colder and smaller. And older and lower. And every day. My treat gets closer to trick. Yeah every day my world gets slower. And colder and smaller. And older and lower. And I'm tired of being alone with myself. And I'm tired of being with anyone else. Yeah, I'm tired.... Like I'm sick. None of my favorite things. Are quite right. To the mirror man. Screaming at me. In the spite of another. False start. Dirty worn out and used. Up and down. To the ground. Disavowed. So confused. All made up in the belief. That me is the same. As the eyes in the glass. But I see my eyes change.... Friends are as strangers. And strangers as friends. And I feel like I'm wired in a why. Yeah my friends are as strangers. And strangers as friends. And I feel like I'm lost in a lie. And every night, my world gets quicker. And lighter and shorter. And tighter and slicker. And every night. My truth gets closer to dare. Yeah every night my world gets quicker. And lighter and shorter. And tighter and slicker. And I'm sick of being alone with myself. And I'm sick of being with anyone else. Yeah I'm sick of being alone with myself. And I'm sick of being with anyone else. Yeah, I'm sick. Like I'm tired?. Like I'm scared..."
taking off,"Tomorrow I can start again. With back to earth and carry on. The same as I did yesterday. Yeah I'll pick it up once more. And morning I'll be onto it. From square one start. And push it for a bit. Like I do everyday.... I'll get it down for sure. But tonight I climb with you. Tonight. So high with you. Tonight I shine with you. Tonight. Oh I'm so alive with you. Tomorrow I'll begin again. With heavy head to hold it. As I do it all like yesterday. Yeah I'll break it out again. And morning I'll be there in time. For clock back move. And make it for awhile. To get through everyday.... I'll roll it out the same. But tonight I climb with you. Tonight. So high with you. Tonight I shine with you. Tonight I'm so alive.... With you it's always here and never there. With you it's always here and never where. With you it's always here and never how. With you it's always here and always now.

the 13th,"""everyone feels good in the room"" she swings. ""two chord cool in the head"" she sings. ""a-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees... "". tell me this is not for real. please tell me this is not for real.... From time to time her eyes get wide. and she's always got them stuck on me. I’m surprised at how hot honey-coloured and hungry she looks. and I have to turn away to keep from bursting. yeah I feel that good!. She slips from the stage. a foot no more. but it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor. and the two chord cool still grooves. as she slides towards me smooth as a snake. I can't swallow I just start to shake. and I just know this is a big mistake. yeah but it feels good!. Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!. Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!. ""if you want I can take you on another kind of ride... "". ""believe me I would but... "". deep inside the 'but' is 'please'. I am yearning for another taste. and my shaking is 'yes'. ""you will be all the things in the world you've never been. see all the things in the world you've never seen. dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed... "". but I think I get a bit confused.... Am I seducing or being seduced?. Oh I know that tomorrow I’ll feel bad. but I really couldn't care about that. she's grinning singing spinning me round and round. smiling as I start to fall. her face gets big her face gets small. it's like tonight I’m really not me at all. and it feels good!. Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!. Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!. It feels good!."
the baby screams,Heaven. Give me a sign. Waiting for the sun to shine. Pleasure fills up my dreams. And I love it. Like a baby screams. Its so useless. How can you be proud. When you're sinking into the ground. Into the ground fills up my dreams. And I love it. Like a baby screams. Couldn't ask for more you said. Take it all. And strike me. Strike me dead. Waiting again. Waiting. Like I waited before. Waiting again. Waiting here for nothing at all. Heaven fills up my dreams. And I love it. Like a baby screams. Couldn't ask for more you said. Couldn't ever let it end. Take it all. Take it all. And strike me dead. Heaven!. Heaven!.
the big hand,The big hand makes all of your favourite things. Like all your dreams go small. And all your friends run away. Until your memories fall. And the words don't fit. But the way the big hand smiles. You just won't care about it. The big hand makes all of your favourite things. Like all your days run out. And all your hopes disappear. And your smiles just stop. And your eyes go dead. And the shadows start to crawl. In the back of your head. But when the big hand speaks. It's like fireworks and heaven. So you listen don't think. And wish for nothing at all. And when the big hand sings. It's like fireworks and friends. Leaving alone I'm not. Leaving alone. Leaving alone I'll never. Leave alone again. So when the big hand holds up all your favourite things. And with a touch like glass. Starts to squeeze. You don't ask. 'Why me?'. You just slip to the floor. Just slip to your knees. But when the big hand speaks. It's like fireworks and heaven. So you listen don't think. And wish for nothing at all. And when the big hand sings. It's like fireworks and friends. Leaving alone I'm not. Leaving alone. Leaving alone never leaving alone. Leaving alone I'm not. Leaving alone. Leaving alone. I'm not leaving alone again
the blood,"Tell me who doesn't love. What can never come back. You can never forget how it used to feel. The illusion is deep. It's as deep as the night. I can tell by your tears you remember it all. I am paralysed by the Blood of Christ. Though it clouds my eyes. I can never stop, never stop. How it feels to be dry. Walking bare in the sun. Every mirage I see is a mirage of you. As I cool in the twilight. Taste the salt on my skin. I recall all the tears. All the broken words. I am paralysed by the Blood of Christ. Though it clouds my eyes. I can never stop. When the sunset's glow drifts away from you. You'll no longer know. If any of this was really true at all.... I am paralysed by the Blood of Christ. Though it clouds my eyes. I can never stop, never stop. Tell me who doesn't love. What can never come back. You can never forget how it used to feel. I am paralysed by the Blood of Christ. Though it clouds my eyes. I can never stop, never stop. I am paralysed by the Blood of Christ. Though it clouds my eyes. I can never stop, never stop"
the caterpillar,Flicka flicka flicka!. Here you are. Cata cata cata!. Caterpillar girl. Flowing in. And filling up my hopeless heart. Oh never never go. Dust my lemon lies. With powder pink and sweet. The day I stop. Is the day you change. And fly away from me. You flicker. And you're beautiful. You glow inside my head. You hold me hypnotized. I'm mesmerized.... Your flames. The flames that kiss me dead.
the crying game,"I know all there is to know about the crying game. I've had my share of the crying game. First there are kisses, then there are sighs. And then before you know where you are. You're sayin' goodbye. One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game. And if he knows maybe he'll explain. Why there are heartaches, why there are tears. And what to do to stop feeling blue. When love disappears. I know all there is to know about the crying game. I've had my share of the crying game. First there are kisses, then there are sighs. And then before you know where you are. You're sayin' goodbye. Don't want no more of the crying game. Don't want no more of the crying game. Don't want no more of the crying game. Don't want no more of the crying game."
the dream,You're too far away. Too far away to touch. And this mother's love inside me. Hurts too much. Prettily waving. Playing on the sand. Dreaming of everything. Dancing. Dancing in our hands. Dancing. Dancing. Dizzy dizzy dizzy. As I speak. Like a tumbling cat. I watch in fascination. Like a vampire bat. Don't do it don't do it. Don't do it don't do it. Don't give it away. We'll use it up tomorrow. If we don't use it today. Rest your head. Oh just put it outside. All wrapped up in ribbons. The night. The dream. The time love died. We pushed it in our mouths. Pushed it deep inside. All wrapped up in ribbons. The night. The dream. The time. Love died
the drowning man,She stands twelve feet above the flood. She stares. Alone. Across the water. The loneliness grows and slowly. Fills her frozen body. Sliding downwards. One by one her senses die. The memories fade. And leave her eyes. Still seeing worlds that never were. And one by one the bright birds leave her.... Starting at the violent sound. She tries to turn. But final. Noiseless. Slips and strikes her soft dark head. The water bows. Receives her. And drowns her at its ease.... I would have left the world all bleeding. Could I only help you love. The fleeting shapes. So many years ago. So young and beautiful and brave. Everything was true. It couldn't be a story.... I wish it was all true. I wish it couldn't be a story. The words all left me. Lifeless. Hoping. Breathing like the drowning man. Oh Fucshia!. You leave me. Breathing like the drowning man. Breathing like the drowning man.
the empty world,As stiff as toys. And tall as men. And swaying like the wind torn trees. She talked about the empty world. With eyes like poisoned birds. She talked about the armies. That marched inside her head. And how they made her dreams go bad. But oh!. How happy she was!. How proud she was!. To be fighting in the war. In the empty world!.
the end of the world,The End Of The World. Go if you want to. I never tried to stop you. Know there's a reason. For all of this you're feeling. Love it's not my call. You couldn't ever love me more. You couldn't love me more. You couldn't love. Me I don't show much. It's not that hard to hide. You see in a moment. I can't remember how to. Be all you wanted. I couldn't ever love you more. I couldn't love you more. I couldn't love. You want me to cry and play my part. I want you to sigh and fall apart. We want this like everyone else. Stay if you want to. I always wait to hear you say. There's a last kiss. For all the times you run this way. It's not my fault. You couldn't ever love me more. You couldn't love me more. You couldn't love. Love me more. I couldn't ever love you more. I couldn't love you more. I couldn't love. You want me to lie not break your heart. I want you to fly not stop and start. We want us like everything else. Maybe we didn't understand. It's just the end of the world. Maybe we didn't understand. Not just a boy and a girl. It's just the end of the. end of the world. Me I don't say much. It's far too hard to make you. See in a moment. I still forget just how to. Be all you wanted. I couldn't ever love you more. I couldn't love you more. I couldn't love you more. I couldn't love you more. I couldn't love you more
the exploding boy,I couldn't hear a word you said. I couldn't hear at all. You talked until your tongue fell out. And then you talked some more. I knew if I turned. I'd turn away from you. And I couldn't look back. Tell yourself we'll start again. Tell yourself it's not the end. Tell yourself it couldn't happen. Not this way. Not today
the figurehead,Sharp and open. Leave me alone. And sleeping less every night. As the days become heavier and weighted. Waiting. In the cold light. A noise. A scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten. With spiders inside them. And dust on the lips of a vision of hell. I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year. A hundred other words blind me with your purity. Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance. I think about tomorrow. Please let me sleep. As I slip down the window. Freshly squashed fly. You mean nothing. You mean nothing. I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls. All the time. Lose me in the dark. Please do it right. Run into the night. I will lose myself tomorrow. Crimson pain. My heart explodes. My memory in a fire. And someone will listen. At least for a short while.... I can never say no to anyone but you. Too many secrets. Too many lies. Writhing with hatred. Too many secrets. Please make it good tonight.... But the same image haunts me. In sequence. In despair of time. I will never be clean again. I touched her eyes. Pressed my stained face. I will never be clean again. Touch her eyes. Press my stained face. I will never be clean again. I will never be clean again.

the funeral party,Two pale figures. Ache in silence. Timeless. In the quiet ground. Side by side. In age and sadness. I watched. And acted wordlessly. As piece by piece. You performed your story. Moving through an unknown past. Dancing at the funeral party. Memories of childrens' dreams. Lie lifeless. Fading. Lifeless. Hand in hand with fear and shadows. Crying at the funeral party. I heard a song. And turned away. As piece by piece. You performed your story. Noiselessly across the floor. Dancing at the funeral party
the hanging garden,Creatures kissing in the rain. Shapeless in the dark again. In the hanging garden. Please don't speak. In the hanging garden. No one sleeps. Catching haloes on the moon. Gives my hands the shapes of angels. In the heat of the night. The animals scream. In the heat of the night. Walking into a dream.... Fall fall fall fall. Into the walls. Jump jump out of time. Fall fall fall fall. Out of the sky. Cover my face as the animals cry. In the hanging garden. Creatures kissing in the rain. Shapeless in the dark again. In a hanging garden. Change the past. In a hanging garden. Wearing furs and masks.... Fall fall fall fall. Into the walls. Jump jump out of time. Fall fall fall fall. Out of the sky. Cover my face as the animals die. In the hanging garden. In the hanging garden.
the holy hour,I kneel and wait in silence. As one by one the people slip away. Into the night. The quiet and empty bodies. Kiss the ground before they pray. Kiss the ground. And slip away.... I sit and listen dreamlessly. A promise of salvation makes me stay. Then look at your face. And feel my heart pushed in. As all around the children play. The games they tired of yesterday. They play. I stand and hear my voice. Cry out. A wordless scream at ancient power. It breaks against stone. I softly leave you crying.... I cannot hold what you devour. The sacrifice of penance. In the holy hour.
the hungry ghost,"All the things we never know we need. Looks like we get them in the end. Measure time in leisure time and greed. And by the time we get to spend. A floating bed. A head of stone. A home plugged into every phone. Kimono coral floral print. Exclusive tint and cut reclusive. No it doesn't come for free. But it's the price. We pay for happiness. No don't talk about more to life than this. Dream a world maybe no one owns. No don't think about all the life we miss. Swallow doubt as the hunger grows. Make believe it's like no one knows. Even if we turn more to most. We'll never satisfy the hungry ghost. All the stuff we know we never want. Seems like we get it anyway. Safe to say it isn't really wrong. But when we know we only.... Yeah, throw it all away. Yeah, all of this we never know we want. It's like we get it anyway. Safe to say it isn't ever wrong. Better to get than to delay. A 3D screen. A cleaner pit. A bit pulled out of every hit. Addicted latest greatest piece. Design caprice and make the headline. No it doesn't come for free. But it's the price. We pay for happiness. No don't talk about more to life than this. Dream a world maybe no one owns. No don't think about all the life we miss. Swallow doubt as the hunger grows. Make believe it's like no one knows. Even if we turn more to most. We'll never satisfy the hungry ghost. And all of this. We know we never need. Well it's the price. We pay for happiness. Yeah"
the kiss,Kiss me kiss me kiss me!. Your tongue is like poison. So swollen it fills up my mouth. Love me love me love me!. You nail me to the floor. And push my guts all inside out. Get it out get it out get it out!. Get your fucking voice. Out of my head!. I never wanted this. I never wanted any of this. I wish you were dead. I wish you were dead. I never wanted any of this. I wish you were dead. Dead. Dead. Dead
the last day of summer,Nothing I am. Nothing I dream. Nothing is new. Nothing I think or believe in or say. Nothing is true. It used to be so easy. I never even tried. Yeah it used to be so easy.... But the last day of summer. Never felt so cold. The last day of summer. Never felt so old. Never felt so.... All that i have. All that i hold. All that is wrong. All that i feel for or trust in or love. All that is gone. It used to be so easy. I never even tried. Yeah it used to be so easy.... But the last day of summer. Never felt so cold. The last day of summer. Never felt so old. The last day of summer. Never felt so cold. Never felt so...
the loudest sound,"side by side in silence. they pass away the day. so comfortable, so habitual.... and so nothing left to say. nothing left to say. nothing left to say. side by side in silence. his thoughts echo round. he looks up at the sky.... she looks down at the ground. stares down at the ground. stares down at the ground. side by side in silence. they wish for different worlds. she dreams him as a boy.... and he loves her as a girl. loves her as a girl.... and side by side in silence. without a single word.... it's the loudest sound. it's the loudest sound.... it's the loudest sound i ever heard."
the lovecats,We move like cagey tigers. We couldn't get closer than this. The way we walk. The way we talk. The way we stalk. The way we kiss. We slip through the streets. While everyone sleeps. Getting bigger and sleeker. And wider and brighter. We bite and scratch and scream all night. Let's go and throw. All the songs we know.... Into the sea. You and me. All these years and no one heard. I'll show you in spring. It's a treacherous thing. We missed you hissed the lovecats. We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully. Wonderfully pretty!. Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.... We should have each other to tea huh?. We should have each other with cream. Then curl up by the fire. And sleep for awhile. It's the grooviest thing. It's the perfect dream. Into the sea. You and me. All these years and no one heard. I'll show you in spring. It's a treacherous thing. We missed you hissed the lovecats. We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully. Wonderfully pretty!. Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.... We should have each other to dinner huh?. We should have each other with cream. Then curl up in the fire. Get up for awhile. It's the grooviest thing. It's the perfect dream. Hand in hand. Is the only way to land. And always the right way round. Not broken in pieces. Like hated little meeces.... How could we miss. Someone as dumb as this?. I love you... let's go.... Oh... solid gone.... How could we miss. Someone as dumb as this?.
the only one,"Oh I love, Oh I love, Oh I love. What you do to my head. When you pull me upstairs. And you push me to bed.. I love what you do to my head.. It's a mess out there!. Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love. What you do to my heart. When you push me back down. And then pull me apart.. I love what you do to my heart.. It's the best, oh yeah!. Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love. What you do to my lips. When you suck me inside. And you blow me a kiss.. I love what you do to my lips. It's so sweet in there.. Oh I love, love, love, love. What you do to my hips. When you blow me outside. And then suck me like this.. I love what you do to my hips. It's the beat oh yeah!. You're the only one I cry for. The only one I try to please.. You're the only one I sigh for. The only one I die to squeeze.. And it gets better everyday, I play. With you it's such a scream.. Yeah it gets better everyday, I say. With you it's so extreme.. Yeah it gets wetter everyday, I stay. With you it's like a dream.. Oh I love, Oh I love, Oh I love. What you do to my skin.. Please slip me on. And slide me in.. I love what you do to my skin. It's a passion oh yeah.. Oh I love, love, love, love. What you do to my bones. When you slide me up. And take me home.. I love what you do to my bones. It's the crush oh yeah.. You're the only one I cry for. The only one I try to please.. You're the only one I sigh for. The only one I die to squeeze.. And it gets hazier anyway, I sway. With you it's such a scream. Yeah it gets mazier every play, I say. With you it's so extreme.. Yeah it gets crazier everyday, I stay. With you it's like a dream.. Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love. What you do to me.. . . *Mila*"
the perfect boy,"""You and me are the world"", she said. Nothing else is real. The two of us is all there is. The rest is just a dream. Always meant to be. I can feel it like a destiny thing. Written in the stars, inescapable fate. Yeah, it's out of my hands falling into your arms. And I don't want to get innocent. But I would love you to take my time. ""We're on the edge of a beautiful thing"", she said. Come on, let's stay here for a while. Oh girl, he is the one for sure. Oh girl, he is the perfect boy. ""Yeah, me and you are a world"", he said. But not the only one I need. The two of us is never all there is. That doesn't happen for real. If it was meant to be us, it was meant to be now. Don't see the sense in wasting time. If you're so sure about this Laurel kismet Hardy thing. You know tonight you're mine. And I don't want to get obvious. But I have to be gone by three. ""We're on the edge of a beautiful thing"", he said. So come on jump with me. Oh girl, he's not the one for sure. Oh girl, he's not so wonderful. Oh girl, he's not the one for sure. Oh girl, he's not the perfect boy at all. ""You and me are the world"", she says. Nothing else is real. The two of us is all there is. The rest is just a dream. And her heart maybe broken a hundred times. But the hurt will never destroy her hope. The happy ever after girl. One day finds the perfect boy"
the perfect girl,You're such a strange girl. I think you come from another world. You're such a strange girl. I really don't understand a word. You're such a strange girl. I'd like to shake you around and around. You're such a strange girl. I'd like. To turn you. All upside down. You're such a strange girl. The way you look like you do. You're such a strange girl. I want to be with you. I think I'm falling. I think I'm falling in. I think I'm falling in love with you. With you.
the promise,How time will heal. Make me forget. You promised me. Time will heal. Make me forget. You promised me. Love will save us all. And time will heal. You promised me.... How love will save. Make me forget. You promised me. Love will save. Make me forget. You promised me. Time will heal us all. And love will save. You promised me.... I trusted you. I wanted your words. Believed in you. I needed your words. Time will heal. make me forget. And love will save us all. You promised me another wish. Another way. You promised me another dream. Another day. You promised me another time. You promised me another life. You promised me... So I swallowed the shame and I waited. I buried the blame and I waited. Choked back years of memories.... I pushed down the pain and I waited. Trying to forget.... You promised me another wish. Another way. You promised me another dream. Another day. You promised me another time. You promised me.... Another lie. Oh you promised me.... You promised me... You promised me.... And I waited... And I waited... And I waited.... And I'm still waiting...
the real snow white,"You've got what I want. You've got what I want. Yeah, you've got what I want. You've got what I want. You've got what I want. You've got what I want. You've got what I want. Oh yeah!. It's only for the night. And I will give it back tomorrow I swear. She can barely breathe. Don't stare. I know the dress is tight. But it was all I had to wear. Give me what I need. Please share. You know it's only right. And I would never lie to you. I wouldn't dare.... I made a promise to myself. I wouldn't start with anyone else but.... You know how it is with these promises. Made in the heat of the moment. They're made to be broken in two. Sometimes the only thing to do. Oh no!. It's all coming back. How I came to in a sticky 3 day hole. Didn't see the sign. Go Slow. Too busy tuning static on the radio. She hissed it in a song. ""Don't go.... it always fades to black"". But that's why I love the trip, it's so inevitable. I made a promise to myself. I wouldn't fall for anyone else but.... You know how it is with these promises. Made in the heat of the moment. They're made to be less than they seem. Whenever you've got what I need. And you've got what I need.... You've got what I need. You've got what I need. AAAIIIIEEE!. For service with a smile. I have to walk in on my hands. and roll for free. You say it's all the same. Ennui.... You're not the real Snow White. The real Snow White is on my knee. I didn't need to get. ID. It's simply minimum height. And getting all dressed up. In seven ways to please. Yeah. I made a promise to myself. I wouldn't stay with anyone else but.... You know how it is with these promises. Made in the heat of the moment. They're made to be broken one day. If there's no time to get away. Uh oh!. She wasn't made to shine. She was really only ever made to glow. I left her in the dark. No show. Quiet sucking on a line. It was a tricky gun to load. And I didn't get to fire. Hi-Ho!. She's off to work for time. And I should have finished out with higher. Up than low. Yeah, I made a promise to myself. I wouldn't stop with anyone else but.... You know how it is with these promises. Made in the heat of the moment. They're made befor right becomes wrong. Whenever you've got what I want. Whenever you've got what I want. Whenever you've got what I want. Whenever you've got what I want. And you've got what I want. You've got what I want. You've got what I want. Oh yeah!. It's only for the night. And I will give it back tomorrow. I swear"
the reasons why,"I won't try to bring you down about my suicide. Got no need to understand about my big surprise. I won't beg to hang you up about my love of life. If you promise not to sing about the reasons why. I am writing you a letter. Getting better. Can I see you?. When.... All the lights go out together. Blame the weather. Yeah the cold again. In the darkness for a second. I am sure I see them smiling then. I feel them calling me. Yeah they are calling me.... And I am falling through the stars. You remember now?. Yeah I am falling in their arms. You remember how?. Oh I am falling through the sky. You remember this ?. I am falling in their eyes. You remember the kiss?. I won't try to pull you in about my sacrifice. Makes no sense to get upset about the other side. I won't beg to put you out about my right to die. If you promise not to sing about the reasons why. I am calling you at midnight. Feeling alright...can I tell you?. When?. On the line no sound but my words. Must be night birds on the wire again. In the silence for a second. I am sure I hear them laughing then. I feel them calling me. Yeah they are calling me.... I am falling through the stars. You remember now. Yeah, I am falling in their arms. You remember how. I am falling through the sky. You remember this. I am falling in their eyes. You remember the kiss. ""We know"". They said. ""You're holding on. To nothing left of something gone"". ""We know"". They said. ""In letting go. Of fear and dread. And all you know. You'll lose the need of certainty. And make-believe eternity. To find the true reality. In beautiful infinity...."". But I won't try to bring you down about my suicide. If you promise not to sing about the reasons why"
the same deep water as you,"Kiss me goodbye. Pushing out before I sleep. Can't you see I try. Swimming the same deep water as you is hard. ""The shallow drowned lose less than we"". You breathe. The strangest twist upon your lips. ""And we shall be together... "". ""Kiss me goodbye. Bow your head and join with me"". And face pushed deep. Reflections meet. The strangest twist upon your lips. And disappear. The ripples clear. And laughing. Break against your feet. And laughing. Break the mirror sweet. ""So we shall be together... "". ""Kiss me goodbye"". Pushing out before I sleep. It's lower now and slower now. The strangest twist upon your lips. But I don't see. And I don't feel. But tightly hold up silently. My hands before my fading eyes. And in my eyes. Your smile. The very last thing before I go.... I will kiss you I will kiss you. I will kiss you forever on nights like this. I will kiss you I will kiss you. And we shall be together..."
the scream,Yeah I've been this way before. But something down here changed. The Spring sun hanging slower. Colder in the sky. And your voice sounds strange. Your voice sounds strange. Yeah I've been down here before. But this time. Something really isn't right. Summer sun hangs smaller. Paler in the sky. And your eyes are too bright. Your eyes are too bright. It's like everything I know. Is twisted out and wrong. The Fall sun hanging flatter. Lower in the sky. And your smile is gone. Your smile is gone. It's like twisted out I know. Now I can't wake to. Break apart this dream. Winter sun hangs weaker. Older in the sky. And you start to scream. You start to scream. You start to scream.... Scream and you scream. This is not a dream. This is how it really is. There isn't any other this. Is not a dream. Scream and you scream. Why you have this need. Why you can't be satisfied. Always want another why. You have this need. Scream and you scream. Dare me to believe. Dare me now to show I care. One last chance to make the dare. Me to believe. Scream and you scream. How we ended here. How we got from then to now. Never really followed how. We ended here
the snakepit,Well we're a mile under the ground. And I'm thinking that it's Christmas. And I'm kissing you hard. Like I've got very important business. And no-one knows. And no-one sees us. Because they're drinking their selves senseless. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing in the snakepit. Well I'm out in a car. And it's just full of stupid girls. And I've forgotten how to speak. And I just can't remember a word. And my eyes feel like they're bursting. And they're splitting like plums. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing. And I'm writhing in the snake pit
the top,"""I don't care"". If only I could say that. And not feel so sick and scared. ""I don't care"". If only I could say that. If only my eyes would close.... ""It's Jesus brilliant"". You used to laugh. ""Walking these gorgeous blocks.... This top is the place. Where nobody goes. You just imagine. You just imagine it all... "". Every day I lie here. And know that it's true. All I really want is you. Please come back. Please come back. Like all the other ones do.... Please come back. All of you...."
the upstairs room,I love it all. These games we play. I close my eyes. You run away. I'm sure I asked you to stay. But now you're gone. And so I feel the grey. Pulse in my head. I turn off the lights and crawl into bed. I try to think of sunshine. But my body goes wet. With the first crash of thunder. I don't think I can know. Anyone but you dear. That's for sure. When it gets to four. It's my turn to go. Oh the kiss. So alcoholic and slow. Arranging me for Saturday. I thought you would know. That I always sleep. Alone. I don't think I can know. Anyone but you. Dear. That's for sure. The upstairs room is cool and bright. We can go up there in summer. And dance all night. Your sister started talking at a minute after ten. So everyone jumped up. And then fell over again. In April you can join them. And stare at me. At the ghost from your past
the walk,I called you after midnight. Then ran until I burst. I passed the howling woman. And stood outside your door. We walked around a lake. And woke up in the rain. And everyone turned over. Troubled in their dreams again. Visiting time is over. And so we walk away. And both play dead then cry out loud. Why we always cry this way?. I kissed you in the water. And made your dry lips sing. I saw you look. Like a Japanese baby. In an instant I remembered everything.... I called you after midnight. Then ran until my heart burst. I passed the howling woman. And stood outside your door. I kissed you in the water. And made your dry lips sing. I saw you look. Like a Japanese baby. In an instant I remembered everything...
there is no if,"Remember the first time I told you I love you. It was raining hard and you never heard. You sneezed! and I had to say it over. ""I said I love you"" I said... you didn't say a word. Just held your hands to my shining eyes. And I watched as the rain ran through your fingers. Held your hands to my shining eyes and smiled as you kissed me.... ""if you die"" you said ""so do i"" you said.... And it starts the day you make the sign. ""tell me I'm forever yours and you're forever mine. Forever mine... "". ""if you die"" you said ""so do i"" you said.... And it starts the day you cross that line. ""swear I will always be yours and you'll always be mine. You'll always be mine. Always be mine... "". Remember the last time I told you I love you. It was warm and safe in our perfect world. You yawned and I had to say it over. ""I said I love you"" I said... you didn't say a word. Just held your hands to your shining eyes. And I watched as the tears ran through your fingers. Held your hands to your shining eyes and cried.... ""if you die"" you said ""so do i"" you said.... But it ends the day you see how it is. There is no always forever... just this.... Just this.... ""if you die"" you said ""so do i"" you said. But it ends the day you understand. There is no if... just and. There is no if... just and. There is no if..."
this green city,"Someone's evil laugh shoots down my back. shapeless and ageing we start to run. through the tangle of your broken words. this cheap impulse falls so dry. In the maze. I burn down. turn...you turn my skin around. wishing my eyes could look down. down on me.... Stairs fall like jewels. as we near the door. you fold through my neck. and arms like crystal. so black, so black with charm and breath. we turn to face the dying sun.... This green city rains down on me. this green city rains down on me."
this is a lie,How each of us decides. I’ve never been sure. The part we play. The way we are. How each of us denies any other way in the world. Why each of us must choose. I’ve never understood. One special friend. One true love. Why each of us must lose everyone else in the world. However unsure. However unwise. Day after day play out our lives. However confused. Pretending to know to the end. But this isn't truth this isn't right. This isn't love this isn't life this isn't real. This is a lie. How each of us believes. I’ve never really known. In heaven unseen and hell unknown. How each of us dreams to understand anything at all. Why each of us decides. I’ve never been sure. The part we take. The way we are. Why each of us denies every other way in the world. However unsure. However unwise. Day after day play out our lives. However confused. Pretending to know to the end. But this isn't truth this isn't right. This isn't love this isn't life this isn't real. This is a lie. This isn't truth this isn't right. This isn't love this isn't life this isn't real. This is a lie.
this morning,"Nothing left to feel. Nothing more to do. Nothing left to give. Nothing more in you. Nothing else to have or hold. Nothing left, but time to go. Time to go. Years go by. Didn't really say that much at all. And moments just fly. Didn't ever really touch at all. Weeks always run down. Didn't really get that close at all. And days, days fall out. Didn't ever really know at all. And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright. She stares at you for an hour. You stare into the light. for one last hour in the room. So mean and so white. I stare at her in this room as she stares into the night. Nothing left to feel. Nothing more to do. Nothing left to ask. Nothing more of you. Nothing else to share or show. Nothing left but time to go. In his eyes as we turn no eternity of life. In his eyes as we turn no infinity of why. In his eyes as we turn no beautiful goodbye. In his eyes as we turn... Nothing But Tears. In his eyes as we turn... Nothing But Tears. (Robert talks in a low voice:) I couldn't understand too much of what was being said, in a matter of minutes,. peacefully so slow, I had to think to breath, my heart burst, we moved in silence really slowly away from the world,. as we drove a strange silence, that moment, nothing will ever be the same, nothing will ever be the same, nothing. will ever be the same. Days fall out. Weeks always run down. Moments just fly. Weeks go by. And then were here. And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright. I stare at you for an hour. You stare into the light. For one last hour in the room so mean and so white. You stare at me in this room as I stare into the night. Nothing left to feel. Nothing more to do. Nothing more to take. Nothing more from you. Nothing else to need or know. There's nothing left at all...but time to go"
this twilight garden,I lift my lips from kissing you. To kiss the sky. Cloud soft and blue. And slow the sun melts down. Into your golden words for me. I lift my hands from touching you. To touch the wind that whispers through. This twilight garden. Turns into a world. Where dreams are real. No-one will ever take your place. I am lost in you. No-one will ever take your place. So in love with you. I lift my eyes from watching you. To watch the star rise shine onto. Your dreaming face and dreaming smile. You're dreaming worlds. For me. I lift my lips from kissing you. And kiss the sky wide deepest blue. And slow the moon swims up. Into your golden words. For me. No-one will ever take your place. I am lost in you. No-one will ever take your place. So in love with you
this. here and now. with you,"This. Here and now. With you. This. Here and now. With you. ""Please don't ask me who I am. Or when and where my life began. Or why I ended up like this or how. Don't ask me what I was before. If I was anything at all. It's nothing you can know. About me now"". You hold my spinning head to stare. And strip me bare of memory. Of black eyes burning into me. So slow. The sounds and lights and others fade. And fall away in symmetry. Your black eyes burning hungrily. And unafraid, I know.... Everything I ever dared forget is here. Too scared before I never let. Tonight be all I need. Everywhere I never tried to get is here. Too tired before to ever let. Tonight be all I feel. Every time I ever thought regret is here. Too caught before I never let. Tonight be all I dreamed. There isn't any yesterday. Tomorrow starts a day away. This here and now with you is how. Always should always be. This. Here and now. With you. This. Here and now. With you. ""I can't believe it's coming true. I'm so up close to kissing you. A breath away from never going home. I don't remember getting here. It seems to be sometime next year. I hope you won't be.... Leaving me alone?"". ""No please don't tell me who I am. Or when and where my life began. Or why I ended up like this, or how. Don't tell me what I was before. If I was anything at all. It's nothing you can know. About me now"". You pull my shaking body close. To make the most of tangency. I bite your mouth so fearfully. And slow. The taste of summers yet to shine. A perfect time to change the scene. I bite your mouth in urgency. And terrified I know. Everything I ever dared forget is here. Too scared before I never let. Tonight be all I need. Everywhere I never tried to get is here. Too tired before to ever let. Tonight be all I feel. Every time I ever thought regret is here. Too caught before I never let. Tonight be all I dreamed. There isn't any yesterday. Tomorrow starts a day away. This here and now with you is how. Always should always be. This. Here and now. With you. This. Here and now. With you"
three imaginary boys,Walk across the garden. In the footsteps of my shadow. See the lights out. No-one's home. In amongst the statues. Stare at nothing in. The garden moves.... Can you help me?. Close my eyes. And hold so tightly. Scared of what the morning brings. Waiting for tomorrow. Never comes. Deep inside. The empty feeling. All the night time leaves me. Three imaginary boys. Slipping through the door. Hear my heart beat in the hallway. Echoes. Round and round. Inside my head. Drifting up the stairs. I see the steps behind me. Disappearing.... Can you help me?. Close my eyes. And hold so tightly. Scared of what the morning brings. Waiting for tomorrow. Never comes. Deep inside. The empty feeling. All the night time leaves me. Three imaginary boys sing in my. Sleep sweet child. The moon will change your mind.... See the cracked reflection. Standing still. Before the bedroom mirror. Over my shoulder. But no-one's there. Whispers in the silence. Pressing close behind me. Pressing close behind. Can you help me?. Can you help me?.
throw your foot,It's funny how your face gets bigger. Gets bigger in this atmosphere. And your mouth goes dry. With every move you try. It's so funny here. Jumping around -- click click click. When you're so slow. It's like the world is stopping. Fifteen times I try this. And every time I faint. You look at me and. Start to tell the joke. About the man who couldn't stop. Hiccupping. It would be so perfect. If you would just fall out the window. Throw your foot away. You're tired and your face is grey. Like the sad old fool. You groove. Hey hey hey
to the sky,"One perfect morning I was all alone. Listening to the blaze of summer. Drifting, I was falling, I was floating in a golden haze. Breathing in the sky-blue sun of memories of other days. And in my dreams I was a child. Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes. And I was floating through the colors of the sky. Up to the stars and angels. Up, up, up to heaven. Up, up, up forever. (repeat). Turning in my prime I looked down on a lake. Traced upon the water there I saw your face. Descending with redemption of the times we've shared. Pushed down ever then up into the sky. And in my dreams I was a child. Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes. And I was floating through the colors of the sky. Up to the stars and angels. Up, up, up to heaven. Up, up, up forever"
to wish impossible things,Remember how it used to be. When the sun would fill the sky. Remember how we used to feel. Those days would never end. Those days would never end. Remember how it used to be. When the stars would fill the sky. Remember how we used to dream. Those nights would never end. Those nights would never end. It was the sweetness of your skin. It was the hope of all we might have been. That filled me with the hope to wish. Impossible things. To wish impossible things. But now the sun shines cold. And all the sky is grey. The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears. And all I wish. Is gone away. All I wish. Is gone away. All I wish. Is gone away
torture,"I'm in the room without a light. The room without a view. I'm here for one more treacherous night. Another night with you. It tortures me to move my hands. To try to move at all. And pulled. My skin so tight it screams. And screams and screams. And pulls some more. Hanging like this. Like a vampire bat. Hanging like this. Hanging on your back. I'm helpless again. My body is cut and broken. It's shattered and sore. My body is cut wide open. I can't stand anymore. It tortures me to move my hands. To try to move at all. And pulled. My skin so tight it screams. And screams and screams. And screams for more. Hanging like this. Like a vampire bat. Hanging like this. Hanging on your back. Oh, it's torture. And I'm almost there. It's torture. But I'm almost there. It's torture. But I'm almost there. It's torture. But I'm almost there."
trap,"drowning like a fly in my drink. you drone about being on the brink. but I really don't care what you think. oh I’m sick of it all. sick of it all. I hate the way it's always the same. hate recrimination and blame. and you just wait for me to fuck up again. oh I’m sick of it all. sick of it all. the ways you try and put me down. sweet revenge for the things I’ve done. the ways you try and twist me around. ""give me a taste of my own medicine"". drowning like a fly in my drink. you whine about being out of synch. but I really don't care what you think. oh I’m sick of it all. sick of it all. I hate the way you want me to be. hate regret and humility. and you just wait for me to fall at your feet. oh I’m sick of it all. sick of it all. the ways you try and run me down. make me pay for the things I’ve been. the ways you try and push me around. all you want to do is win. any love you once felt for me. has turned into this travesty. of selfishness and jealousy. so why can't you just let me go?. Any love you once felt for me. has turned into this travesty. of selfishness and jealousy. so why can't I just let you go?."
treasure,"she whispers. ""please remember me. when I am gone from here"". she whispers. ""please remember me. but not with tears.... Remember I was always true. remember that I always tried. remember I loved only you. remember me and smile.... For it's better to forget. than to remember me. and cry"". ""remember I was always true. remember that I always tried. remember I loved only you. remember me and smile.... For it's better to forget. than to remember me. and cry... ""."
trust,There is no-one left in the world. That I can hold onto. There is really no-one left at all. There is only you. And if you leave me now. You leave all that we were. Undone. There is really no-one left. You are the only one. And still the hardest part for you. To put your trust in me. I love you more than I can say. Why won't you just believe?.
truth goodness and beauty,"I've been waiting for the lies to end. Holding for the bad to go. I've been hanging for the ugliness to change. Waiting for a world too true. Holding for a world too good. Hanging for a world too beautifuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuul. Wishing for a girl too true. Hoping for a girl too good. Hungry for a girl too beautiful. All I say is a lie she sighs. Nothing I say is true. And all I do is bad she cries. Nothing I do is good. And yeh all I am is ugly. Nothing I am is beautiful at all. Don't get this world. I Don't get this girl. So look, but you wont see it. Listen, and you wont hear it. Reach out, and you wont hold it. You cant know it, but you can free it. You cant name it, but could feel it. I've been waiting for the lies to end. Holding for the bad to go. I've been hanging for the ugliness to change. Waiting for a world too true. Holding for a world too good. Hanging for a world too beautiful... Wishing for a girl...like you. Hoping for a girl...like you. Hungry for a girl...like you. No...not like you...you"
underneath the stars,"Floating here. Like this with you. Underneath the stars. Aligned. For 13 billion years. The view. It's beautiful. And ours alone tonight. Underneath the stars. Spinning round. And round with you. Watching shadows. Melt the light. So shining. From our eyes. A tear. Another space is ours. Alone tonight. Watch as shadows melt. The waves, break. The waves, break. Whisper in my ear, a wish. ""We could drift away so far"". Your voice. Inside of my head. Like this. It's infinite. The hours alone tonight. We could drift away. Flying here. Like this with you. Underneath the stars. Aligned. For 13 billion years. The view. It's beautiful. And ours alone tonight. Underneath the stars. (Everything is gone?). Everything Gone. ?? still to ??. Together as now. Forever as one. In each other's arms. So near and so far. Together as now. Underneath the stars. As the waves, break"
untitled,Hopelessly drift. In the eyes of the ghost again. Down on my knees. And my hands in the air again. Pushing my face in the memory of you again. But I never know if it's real. Never know how I wanted to feel. Never quite said what Iwanted to say to you. Never quite managed the words to explain to you. Never quite knew how to make them believable. And now the time has gone. Another time undone. Hopelessly fighting the devil. Futility. Feeling the moster. Climb deeper inside of me. Feeling him gnawing my heart away. Hungrily. I'll never lose this pain. Never dream of you again.
us or them,"There is no terror in my heart. Death is with us all. We suck him down with our first breath. And spit him out as we fall. There is no terror in my heart. No dread of the unknown. Desire for paradise to be.... We love this on our own. No I don't want you anywhere near me. I don't want you anywhere near me. Get your fucking world out of my head. I don't want you anywhere near me. I don't want you anywhere near me. Get your fucking world out of my head. I don't want your ""us or them"". No I don't need your ""us or them"". Oh I don't want your ""us or them"". I don't need your ""us or them. You're us or them..."". ""I live in knowledge of real truth. And all my gods are great!"". The doleful cant of a bigot. Blinded by fear and hate. You live in knowledge of real truth?. Oh the biggest lie I heard. How sick in your mind and soul. To be scared of my voice and my words. Oh you don't want me anywhere near you. You don't want me anywhere near you. Get my fucking head out of your world. You don't want me anywhere near you. You don't want me anywhere near you. Get my fucking head out of your world. I don't want your ""us or them"". No I don't need your ""us or them"". Oh I don't want your ""us or them"". I don't need your ""us or them"". As the only way this ever ends is ""me"""
wailing wall,The holy city breathed. Like a dying man. It moved with hopeful tears. With the tears of the blind. And on and on as the night drew in. Through broken streets. That sucked me in. My feet were bare and cut with stones. With walking to the promised land. I pushed through crowds. Through seas of prayer. Through twisting hands and choking air. A vulture at the wailing wall. I circled.... Waiting....
waiting...,tonight i'll dream a girl called home. and wake up in tears. all on my own. with the sun coming up. and my head against stone. balcony dressed and drawn. tonight i'll dream a room so far away. frost pale blue. the colour of a perfect day. and then screw up my face. in the mirror. as i wait for the others to call. but if i don't believe in magic. and i don't believe in blood. and i don't believe in miracles. and i don't believe in love. then how come i believe so soon. in a cherry tree girl. and a dust blue room?. tonight i'll dream an hour so long. shadow soft smiles. and everyone loves me. to open my eyes. in a drag myself face undone. hard back into the world. tonight i'll dream a dream i dream. without even trying i'm flying i scream. as i practice the move. i spit at my pillow stained face. and the others all come. but if i don't believe in magic. and i don't believe in blood. and i don't believe in miracles. and i don't believe in love. then how come i believe it seems. in a girl called home. and a world called dreams?.
want,I?m always wanting more. Anything I haven't got. Everything. I want it all. I just can't stop. Planning all my days away. But never finding ways to stay. Or ever feel enough today. Tomorrow must be more. Drink more dreams more bed more drugs. More lust more lies more head more love. More fear more fun more pain more flesh. More stars more smiles more fame more sex. But however hard I want. I know deep down inside. I?ll never really get more hope. Or any more time. Any more time. Any more time. Any more time. I want the sky to fall in. I want lightning and thunder. I want blood instead of rain. I want the world to make me wonder. I want to walk on water. Take a trip to the moon. Give me all this and give me it soon. More drink more dreams more drugs. More lust more lies more love. But however hard I want. I know deep down inside. I?ll never really get more hope. Or any more time. Any more time. Any more time. Any more time

winter,"The soul lives forever, always ends sometime. Now I'm alone, alone and cold under painted skies. Remembering the love that we came alive. I know when I can scream as a lonely cry forever. The summer goes by upon the wind. Goes by as though it has never been. I lift my hand to wipe your tears. Your tears. I just can't go on. Now my love has gone away. Now my imaginary world is fading fast. Dreams I dreamed could never last. I left my innocence in the past. And my broken heart. The summer goes by upon the wind. Goes by as though it has never been.

young americans,"They pulled in just behind the fridge. He lays her down, he frowns. ""Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"". He kissed her then and there. She took his ring, took his babies. It took him minutes, took her nowhere. Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but. Chorus (he). All night. She wants the young American. Young American, young American, she wants the young American. All right. She wants the young American. Scanning life through the picture window. She finds the slinky vagabond. He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but. Heaven forbid, she'll take anything. But the freak, and his type, all for nothing. He misses a step and cuts his hand, but. Showing nothing, he swoops like a song. She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"". Chorus (she). All the way from Washington. Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor. ""We live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more?"". Chorus (he). All night. He wants the young American. Young American, young American, he wants the young American. All right. He wants the young American. Do you remember, your President Clinton?. Do you remember, Bill, you have to pay. Or even yesterday?. Have you have been an un-American?. Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout. Leather, leather everywhere, and. Not a myth left from the ghetto. Well, well, well, would you carry a razor. In case, just in case of depression?. Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors. Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas. Ain't that close to love?. Well, ain't that poster love?. Well, it ain't that Barbie doll. Her heart's been broken just like you have. Chorus (you). All night. You want the young American. Young American, young American, you want the young American. All right. You want the young American. You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler. A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler. Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train. Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache. (I heard the news today, oh boy). I got a suite and you got defeat. Ain't there a man you can say no more?. And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?.
