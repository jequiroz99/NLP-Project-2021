bad is bad,"Bad Is Bad. Went downtown to see my cousin. He plays guitar like a chainsaw buzzin'. In the crowd I see his mom and dad. I said, hey uncle, man your son is bad. Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad. I said cool is a rule but sometimes bad is bad. Across the street, a neon sign. All you can eat for a dollar ninety-nine. This old stew is the baddest in the land. But one dollar's worth was all that I could stand. Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad. I said cool is a rule, but sometimes bad is bad. I came back uptown to see my Marie. Nobody home, so I opened the door with my key. I love you baby was the note that I read. But there's a strange pair of shoes underneath the bed. Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad. I said cool is a rule, but sometimes bad is bad. I said cool is a rule, but sometimes bad is bad. I said cool is a rule, but sometimes bad is bad"
can we ride?,"Can We Ride. I need you by my side. Baby can we ride. Cuz they'll never be another like you baby. I want you in my life. Let me come inside. Cuz no other can make me feel the way that you do. [Lil Rob]. You look so good standing there, and I can't help but stare. You got me Dancing In The Rain like Fred Astaire. Homeboys wanna talk their shit, but I don't care. I just wanna run my fingers through your hair. Hold your hand and hope you feel the vibe too. You're beautiful mija, I think I like you. I'd like to invite you. To hit the town if you'd like to, I bet you light up the night too. There's something about you, that tells me not to leave without you. And so I'm not about to, I'm glad that I found you. You effect everyone around you in a good way, everyday's a good day. You have a smile that drives me wild. You carry yourself with class and style. The kind of girl that I've been searching for. But I don't think I need to search no more, you're such a score. [Chorus]. [Lil Rob]. You could be in the desert, lost without a place to go. But we'd be so in love tat we wouldn't even know. Who needs a tv and who needs a radio. I don't need nothing, just me and my babydoll. You need anything at all give me a call. No matter how big no matter how small. The problem may be, doesn't matter call me baby. I'd like to speak with you, I'd like to spend a week with you. To get to know each other, to find out that we're for each other. You for me, me for you, us for one other. And I can't see it any other way. I imagine us on a sunny summer day. With the top down, your hair blowing in the wind. You look so good and I feel good within. And I think I owe it all to you. There's nothing that my babydoll can't do, I fucking love you. [Chorus]. [Lil Rob]. I wish you could look me in the eye. So you could see my soul and know. That I'm the guy that never wants to make you cry, you'd be my life. Kiss you goodnight, wouldn't wanna go to sleep cuz I'd miss you at night. And that's why I keep you in my dreams. Until I figure out whatever it means. I gotta find the nerve to let you know. And once I have you I won't let you go, let you go. [David Wade]. No matter what I gotta do. I'ma give my love to you. I'ma show you that I need you. Let me show you that I care. No matter what I gotta say. I'ma make sure that you stay. In my life forever more. Babygirl you're the one I've been looking for. [Chorus]"
deborah,Deborah. There's a girl living in this town. She's a fox and she knows it well. All the fellows for miles around want to get her but they never will. Just to have a girl with so much class. They'd crawl a mile over broken glass. And she'd let em do it just for a game. Deborah's her name. Deborah. Heart breaking love making connissure. Deborah. Deborah's her name. She's the kind that never follows fashion. Gotta make up her own. All the other kids quick to catch on act like they've always known. But you should see em when the lights go down.

information,"Information. She's been around me all the while.. Try as I might, I can't forget her smile.. In passing conversation, what did I hear her say?. Where did she come from? Who is that woman anyway?. What can I do to change her mind?. Maybe she thinks that I'm just not her kind.. I think she wants me but she's trying to play hard to get.. When she treats me this way, I wish we'd never met.. Information, that's what I need,. Some information. Where did she come from?. Information, that's what I need.. Some information.. Information, that's what I need,. Some information. Where did she come from?. Information, give me a lead.. Some information.. The lights go down, the music's loud..

ju ju man,"Ju Ju Man. I was just 16 years old,. And Maggie's hair was black as coal.. And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.. Now, her eyes were bright as the stars up above.. Every word Maggie spoke was love.. And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.. Falling in love again,. Falling in love again.. We don't care if we don't ever do. Fall back out again!. Time went on and my love it got stronger.. Me and Maggie couldn't wait any longer.. We had to go to town right away to see the Ju Ju Man.. I said, Please please tell me, Mr. Ju Ju Man,. Read the cards that you've got in your hand.. I've got to make a plan for me and my Maggie love.. Falling in love again,. Falling in love again.. We don't care if we don't ever do. Fall back out again!. Maggie's Mama, she'd like to hang me.. Maggie's Pa, now, I know he'd like to chain me,. Cause he don't understand a word of what I said.. I said, Please, Mr. Ju Ju Man,. Will I be holding Maggie's hand. When the robin sings again in the Spring, next June?. Falling in love again,. Falling in love again.. We don't care if we don't ever do. Fall back out again!"
longevity,"Longevity. [Intro: Inspectah Deck]. Uh, yea.. In my time, I've seen a lot of people come and go.. A lot of new faces, been to a lot of new places.. Wherever we went, we always held it down.. While we conquered new grounds. It's a universal sound.. The Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game.. Yo.... [Chorus (x2): Inspectah Deck]. Not many last in the game. Wu-Tang come through, breakin out the same way we came. This is not an act, this is actual facts. Nothin but experience placed upon the tracks. [Inspectah Deck]. We stand perpendicular with no flaws. Breakin all laws, plus jaws, the writin's on the walls. Heartless, starvin artists, out to get our's. Regardless, marvelous doctrines, we shock this. Fist of the black lotus, bustin out the steel cage. Iron Mic Duel made the front page. Outlaws, out for your's, get down on all fours. Rebel with a cause, without applause to the score. ""Pillagin"" with Donna-Cap, the personna raps. Hittin like a cornerback, blistered on the track. Fully-auto, got the mic blow, strike low. High-caliber flow move the crowd, twist your torso. 2009, block party, Bobby Digital, pop corks to us. and the God's we trust, it's adjust. To the highs that we bring with the lows. In the midst of hell speakin out in morse code. Runnin wild like dogs out the kennel through the venue. Simple chemistry, vitamins plus the minerals. Organic vowels, consonants, syllables. Condition critical, ill individual. Paint a picture too vivid for the visual. Material rips through to the gristle. [Chorus (x2)]. [U-God]. Yo, the messages in my music grab you, stuck in my sentence. Got to spit from the bottom less pit, speakin my vengeance. Masked avenger never surrender my heritage. Killah Hill resident, 5'10"" be my measurement. On land we stand under flags as confederates. You think you rule, pitty the fool when the shell drops. Hot bodies scream to the extreme, damn, I'm delicate. We livin irrevant, intelligent, dirty habit. They full of fragments, abandon all 10 commandments. Damage is done as the records spins, hatred in my features. Untamed, thus these cold blooded creatures bust. Architect gladiator radiates the power. Erupt with corrupt minds, locked in the tower. The crook's pressure cooked invasion be destroyed. Self-employed paranoid androids. [Inspectah Deck]. My rhyme cold winds clear streets and slams shutters. Basic Instinct to tear the roof off the mother. Drastic verbal gymnastics, far from the average. Hold the planet like Galactus. Lone Ranger ancester rolled with stone bangers. Never met a force deadly as my own anger. Clutch performer, raised on the blood soaked corners. A real life with real tight heads, that prey on ya. And not many last on the game. Whether it be lies, fly songs or drugs you slang. In the beginnin, it didn't come fast amongst the gun blast. Strivin, my eyes on lump sums of cash. Cash Rules Everything Around Me, surroundin me with champagne wishes. But I see long distance, a strong vision planted deep within the mental. Mind detect mind and analyze what I sent you. [Chorus (x2)]"
me and the boys,"Me And The Boys. Just a bunch of guys getting in the car. No matter who's driving or for how far.. Feels so good, yeah it's been so long.. No fancy drivers tell us how to drive. Me and the boys.. Just me and the boys.. Me and the boys.. Me and my buddies just like to go. We're having fun. Everybody knows.. We don't fuss and we never cry.. We're just grooving, taking in the sights.. Me and the boys.. Just me and the boys.. Me and the boys.. Don't raise questions about how it's done.. We're just messing round, having fun.. The car gears shifting well up and down.. The muffler smells a lot, but we love the sound.. Me and the boys.. Just me and the boys.. Me and the boys.. It ain't like us to hang around this town. Cause squares just bring us down.. I've got to find me something new.. Don't want to think about what they do.. The future's coming round, and we don't care,. Cause wherever we're going, we'll soon get there.. Me and the boys!. Just me and the boys!. Me and the boys."
other guys girls,"Other Guys Girls. Other guys' girls seem to look even better.. Go out and get them other guys' girls.. Other guys' girls seem to treat them so right.. More charm, no lies.. Other guys' girls.. Other guys' girls always look so disarming,. Oh so charming, so alarming!. Why can't you be like those other guys' girls?. Other guys' girls never have much trouble showing affection,. Other guys' girls.. Other guys' girls seem much better to my eyes.. More charm, no lies.. Other guys' girls.. Other guys' girls, so good to their men!. Other guys' girls so mesmerizing.. Why can't you be like those other guys' girls?. Sometimes, I wonder if it's really me.. All kinds of trouble that I'm giving you.. I must be calm.. And I've got to try to work it out.. Other guys tell me they feel the same way,. Can't keep their eyes off other guys' girls.. They all say that I'm very lucky. They wish they had. This guy's girl.. So, I say I'm sorry, please don't worry.. I'll try to stop my eye from wandering.. TIl I act more like those other guys..

queen of hearts,"Queen Of Hearts. Midnight, I'm a-waiting on the 1205. Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line. Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise. Won't you keep my heart from breaking. If it's only for a very short time. Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you. Baby, it makes me feel so bad. Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done. And baby, I know it makes you sad. But when they're handing out the heartaches. You know you got to have you some. Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you. Lovers, I know you've had a few. You hide your heart beneath the covers. And you tell 'em they're the only one. And others know what I'm going through. It's so hard to be a lover. When you say you only do it for fun. Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you. To keep me away from you. To keep me away from you"
slipping away,"Slipping Away. I can feel you slipping away from me.. A little bit further now every day.. I'm holding on, but I can't believe. This is how you want it to be.. Oh, you're slipping away.. Oh, you're slipping away.. It feels like walking down a long, dark road.. You never talk to me the way you did before.. You ride through the city with your head held high.. And all I can do is watch you go by.. Oh, you're slipping away.. Oh, you're slipping away.. I'm gonna give it all I've got to give.. I've got to hold on, see what tomorrow brings.. You're slipping away, but give me one more try.. One more chance to wipe these tears from my eyes.. You're slipping away.. Oh, you're slipping away."
slow down,"Slow Down. Uh-huh. Yo if I let you tell it, your rhyme style safe enough to sell it. But your weak flows, make me the bomb relic. Rap with Magnums like Tom Selleck. Spray a pumpkin, they don't call me Jane Blaze for nuthin. Now save your bluffin for one of them model chicks. Droppin our modest hit, to prove I'm the hottest bitch. Go all-out like an Islamic clique, I'm on. some Jeffrey Dahmer uncut drama, like when a llama spit. Release hammers to protect my trophies and banners. To be as nice as me, need a whole lot of manners. Unadulterated grammar, femenine stash. In layman terms, mean I'm swimmin in cash. Baby got back, means I'm winnin in ass. Got cameras with no bulbs, lookin to flash. So when I breeze through with more metal than R2-D2. and see you on the low like the D's do, say cheese boo. Chorus: Sauce Money (repeat 2X).

Let every baller walk through me, suck a dick just to talk Gucci. Could care less about his 600. I focus on tricks who fronted, that track shoes, bitch run it. My words slaughter, rap's preferred daughter. Go on a spurt like the Bulls in the third quarter. Got niggaz masturbatin every day though. Hopin I'll move my tongue around they head in a circle like a halo. Now get closer, cause in a minute baby it's over. I come off at the clothes like strip poker (strip poker). You just let a chick smoke ya (chick smoke ya) what's my name?. Blid-aze (Blid-aze), point blank range, I'll make ya brains Swayze. (Your brains Swayze) Yo weak poets, wanna test me or what?.

Play your hand right, I'm trump tight, slip up. get lumped up, see me when the guild points the bums up. CD come with a Phillie in it (word?) witty fillie. and silly widdit while you sound like Milli Vanilli did it. Pity you pitted your weak flows against mines. Since mines sound fifty times better, ten times. Visualize my speech, get a glimpse of the rhyme. Drop a hit with a shine, y'all know it's time. Rap's my duty, platinum acts better know I could. CLAP a cutie, or just kill him with natural beauty (beauty). Who you trustin? The one who gets strong burns. from dustin MC's, or the one who gets strong burns from pussin. Chorus 2X. [Jane Blaze]. Blow now... Slow down.. prestige. Sauce Money here, my nucka. Jane Bond, what?. Q-U. My click. Double oh-dimes. I'll be dere. Yo, slow down baby. I don't think they ready for this"
